My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However, there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately. \ wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle
I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything. \ i can understand that
that dang storm last week upset me \ why did it upset you?
cause it ruined my plans \ What kind of plans did you have going on?
My boyfriend went crazy. He stole my rent money \ I hope you called the cops on him.
i did. I am going to move before I am evicted. I don't want him to know where I live \ Good because he's no good for you. You deserve better.
I got a job offer at another company that pays more, but I turned them down because I've been with my current company for ten years. \ Do you think it was the right decision?

I live alone now and It is hard sometimes but it's good as well. \ its a gift and a curse as they say
As is much of life but it's better to live alone right now and not be abused. I guess I'll take lonely over abuse  \ thats very true
My friend just got engaged to her girlfriend. \ That's great! How exciting!
Is it? I can't even get a boyfriend! \ Yeah I know what you mean. It probably feels like you're losing a friend.
My daughter left for vacation with her friend.  \ Wow! Where did they go?
They went to Coco beach. It is so quiet and boring here without her. \ Aw. You miss her. That's sweet. My daughter won't leave the house so I can miss her lol
 Im glad i'll be able to leave from work on time today \ thats great, are you usually not able to?
work just starts to stack towards the end of the day \ i understand how that goes
i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot \ why is that
because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up \ oh i can understand that
I was mad when I didnt get paid my entire check \ I would be mad too. What happened?
a payroll error \ How long before you get what is owed to you?
Im being evaluated at work soon. \ for your job or mental health?
my job. It might not go well. I missed a lot of work lately. \ hope it turns out well for you
I think I'm going to be single forever. \ Don't say that. There is somebody for every single person on this earth.
Where is my person? \ Don't force it. They usually come around when your not looking.
The other day an intruder broke into my home. I had to hide in the closet while I called the cops. \ That must have been terrifying
It was, the whole time I was shaking and breathing heavily. \ I don't know what I would have done
I saw someone using a trashcan as a drum set on the street yesterday. I was inspired because they were so efficient with what they had! \ thats cool.. take any pics?
Nah, but I stayed a listened for a while. I was just super impressed \ thats cool
i was ready for that test yesterday \ Nice, did you ace it
it was a drug test, but yea! \ I hope you weren't smoking any weed 
I was very taken aback when my neighbor told me he still had his dogs.  \ What exactly do you mean? Did you expect them to be taken away from him?
He is mentally ill for the past few months..He never seemed to be before and he was VERY close to his dogs and said he needed them..He has been outside all day and NO dogs- \ Oh dear, I hope everything works out.
I asked my friend to get stuff for a party, I knew he'd pull through though. \ What kind of party?
It was a birthday party for someone else. \ A close friend? What kind of decorations did he get?
Sometimes I forget to feed my pets. I feel so bad about that it afterwards \ set an alarm on your phone
That's a good idea \ thanks
I cant wait for saturday to get here! \ What happens on saturday?
gonna get druuuuuunk \ Lol, nice
Sometimes I'll forget to feed my dog. I can't help but feel bad about it... \ That's not good at all
Yeah I feel super guilty \ Can't you just leave food out? Or set an alarm on your phone?
I can't afford to go to the salon. \ That sucks

Physics. It was hard but very worth it.  \ It sounds hard! What grade did you get?
I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car. \ Oh that sounds so scary!
It was very scary, i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of? \ I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.
Hi friend, do you like candies? \ yes i do
Me too! I am very sad today, wanna guess why? \ cause you ran out of candles?
I felt bad for not taking a gift to a party i went to yesterday \ Was it a birthday party?
yes \ You probably should feel really bad. Was it a kid's birthday?
I was super surprised when there was a cute skunk in our yard last night! \ Cute? Oh my word
SO SO SO CUTE! They are sweet and just adorable. I had to run out half dressed though to grab my dog- Thank goodness it was dark and late \ I have never seen a skunk outside before. I'm glad too
I have seen many- They are fine as long as you don't bother them, they are so freaking cute :) They waddle too \ Like penguns? that might be cute to see.
Fall semester is about to start and I am so ready. \ It's nice to see someone who loves school! What are you studying?

I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me. \ ohh good luck!
Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now. \ thats cool
I was scared when I went home alone the other day \ Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you normally frightened to go home alone?

25 years. We attended the same kindargerteen and we have been together as friends first since then \ Wow! I have been married for a little over 2 years. What is the secret to a long lasting marriage?
I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it! \ That is terrible.
Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them? \ Maybe? Is it that big of a deal to you?
I never thought I would miss high school. \ Oh I have felt that way before. When did you graduate?
2002. I just didnt have to pay bills back then. I don't like it anymore lol \ I can totally understand that. I was so excited to get out into the 'real' world. I did one enlistment in the military after high school, and now I am in college. Rude awakening after high school!
my girlfriend left me alone that hurts me more and lonley \ I hear you! What happened?
yeah we were broked up for a small fight \ That's not good. I hope you both can communicate about it in a respectful way.

audi q7 \ That is a nice car! I know you are enjoying that!
I do miss the last decade.I was adolescent and had a lot of fun. \ I have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000's. Being an adult is no fun.
No, it's not.Al responsabilities and no fun. I wish i was Peter Pan. \ Yes or rich. When I was a kid I wanted to grow up. Now that I'm old I want to be a kid again.
So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream.  \ Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it. \ Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.
You are never going to believe what I did \ What did you do? 
Well, I normally do not feel comfortable lending things to my friends, but recently I mustered up the trust to loan my friend my vehicle. \ Ouch... Is it just for a day? Is your friend a safe driver?
Well, I have known him for a while and I have never seen him drive crazy, so im just hoping all goes well.  It is just for a day, but a lot can happen in a day. \ Yes... If this makes you feel better.. I lent my car to a friend for a week and thank goodness everything was alright. 
I went shopping yesterday and bought a $2000 bag. My husband is going to kill me.. \ Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks, then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.  
All women have the same problem. It is a guilty pleasure.. \ We all deserve to treat ourselves every now and then.
I am so clumsy! \ Oh that's okay! I am as well. Sometimes I trip for no reason whatsoever.
Me too, I fell in front of a large group the other day on nothing but air. \ That happens to me often. I also trip walking up the stairs quite often. It can be quite embarrassing!
My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart. \ That was such a nice thing to do! She seems very caring!
She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version. \ That is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long! 
I love my job! \ Me too, its the only place I get to get away from my wife's constant nagging.
Oh no I hate to hear that!  \ It's no problem. My work comfort's me just like yours does.
My dog Lola won first place in the dog show. That's my girl! \ Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?
She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for. \ I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!
I am so happy with my life right now! \ That's great! It is so important to be content in life.
I agree! I think it is so important to do what makes you happy! \ What do you do for a living? Does that contribute to your happiness?
I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished. \ That is SO exciting! I remember how that felt!
I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job. \ That will come! The hardest part is over now!
I am applying to grad school. \ Oh wow! Congratulations! I also recently applied for grad school to study Computer Science (seriously). What are you wanting to study?
I'm going to study School Psychology! \ That is very cool! I don't know about you, but I have been stressed out about the whole process.
I love my job.  I get to you tell students that they can't take certain classes at the school I work at. \ That's great that you love your job, that is really important!
I do.  There's just something about telling a student you can't do what you want to do with your education, and you have to do it my way. \ That is a powerful type of position.
My family and I are going on our first cruise next year! \ That sounds exciting!  Where are you going?
We are going to Cozumel! \ I've had a lot of friends go there.  What are your specific plans while you're away?
My dog is walking a bit slower these days, he's 15. \ what breed is he?
He's a miniature pinscher, very small. \ thats cute, i bet hes a great dog

I tried a new Mexican restaurant \ I love Mexican food! How was it?
It was great!. I had fajitas  \ That sounds so good. 
I am going on vacation next week. I had been stressing out trying to find someone to watch my dog. \ That is great. I love dogs. Do you have any family 
Yes. My sister stepped up and said she would watch him for me! Now I can be excited about my trip! \ Yay! That is great. Where are you going for vacation?
I just purchased my first home. \ Wow! That's exciting! Was it what you were looking for?
It was! It is the perfect place on the outside of town. \ That's great. Congrats on your home purchase!
I was super nervous about getting on my flight to Peru last week. \ That is scary! I've never flown before, the only time I have ever been on a plane was when I went skydiving.
Wow! Talk about scary! I love to travel, but I hate flying so much. \ I also enjoy traveling!
Hi. I was driving down the road and seen a man beating a dog. \ did you intervene?
Yes I pulled over and it was too late. The dog was bleeding bad. \ that is awful
i love reading old letters from family members \ I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?
i have some old ones from the korean war \ wow!
I have everything ready for back to school supplies for my son to start school. \ That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.
That is true! I also have his outfit picked out for the first day of school. \ Wow, your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!
I bet my cousin that I could beat him at a game of basketball. He's horrible at playing so I knew I could beat him. \ What did you bet?
I bet him $1000 because that's how good I am. I had no doubt in my mind I could win. I ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too. \ That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?
Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future! \ Yes, I have an Associate's in Nursing.
Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others!  \ Yes, it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!
My son was invited for a sleepover but we don't know the host family very well. \ Did you decline? I would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family. 
Yes, and it was hard to decide because my son really wanted to go.  But you can't just trust anybody these days. \ I agree, you made the right choice. And it gives you time to get to know the hosts before a future sleepover!
My brother likes ordering Hawaiian pizza (with ham and pineapple). I can't even watch him eat it. It makes me gag. \ That does not sound good to me, either. I cannot stand pineapple!
I like it by itself, but not on pizza. That's so gross! \ I think it is too acidic for me.
I enjoy my job. I get to look after many patients every day. \ It sounds like you have a fulfilling job. That's great
I really do, I love caring for these people! \ It's so refreshing to hear someone who really loves what they do.
I just had to pass all of my classes to graduate. \ congratulations!
Thank you! I didn't know if I was going to be able to. \ i am really happy for you
i was sad to hear my mom is in the ER again \ Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.
me too, she has heart problems unfortunately \ I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.
A friend just published her own book. I don't know how she does it! \ That's awesome! What is the name of the book?
I honestly can't remember right now (don't tell her I said that), but I know she worked on it for a long time.  \ That's great. I produce audio and I have an album coming out by the end of the summer! Tell her to keep it up!
My son said his first word the other day. My little man is going to be smart just like his pop's. \ Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?
He said poop. When I heard It I jumped up with joy. That's my boy! \ That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!
The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off \ The company you work for is horrible. They should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.
I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable. \ Ew, that is not good! I wouldn't have been able to stay and eat.
I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning. \ I do not blame you!
I am trying to prepare for my grad school interview. \ Oh wow! That must be quite nerve-wracking, although I am sure that you will do great! What are you planning to study?
Thank you, I am going for Psychology (counseling.) \ Oh wow! Do you want to work in schools?
im envious of my friends who are at the park right now while im stuck inside \ Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!
thats true, i'll be outside in an hour or less! \ That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?
I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental. \ that is awesome, i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home
Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents? \ yes i was
I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone \ That is exciting! I love having pictures to look back on. 
Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times. \ I love being able to reminisce on the past. Time goes by so fast. 
While I was on maternity leave, I worked from home a little bit.  I don't think my boss liked it very much though. \ Oh, well that isn't fair of your boss! Most people wouldn't work at all while are maternity leave, he should be grateful!
You would think, but he would literally yell at me over the phone about things that happened when I wasn't even there. \ Well, sounds like your boss is stressed out too much and taking it out on you! Maybe he needs a long break!
My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait! \ OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?
We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready! \ PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit, go to HUNTS in PCB - it's off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!!
It is eerie, isn't it. You must have felt quite strange. Hope your poor doggie is ok! \ Yes she recovered well. Yes it was strange. I was jumping at every sound because I knew I was the only living thing in the house.. or was I? 
We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave. \ I had Hurricane Matthew come through where I live too! NE FL, I know how you feel, only I couldn't get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!
Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok? \ Yeah you thought ahead, me not so much. Our house was fine but a HUGE mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days. I hope your house was ok too!
I was walking through a trail to get to my house last night and it was pitch black. I was afraid a bear or something might get me lol \ You should have taken a flashlight just in case. 
I was gonna use my phone but it died, so I just sprinted for like half an hour. \ hey at least you got a nice workout in!
Yeah way to look at it positive lol. There was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing. \ That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.
I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous. \ Was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?
It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing. \ Did everything go well or do you not know yet?
My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project! \ Oh man, I bet that is fun
Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse? \ No, I have always wanted one though
I felt very good about a math test. I had studied for it all week. \ That's great! You must feel so accomplished! What math class are you taking?
It was just a simple algebra test, but I wanted to do well \ I can understand that! Math has never been my strongest subject. 
I was surprised when my aunt got me a computer for school. It was very nice of her \ that is great! family is the best
Yeah, I was grateful for sure \ i can imagine
 i felt sick after eating too much ice cream last night \ I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick
its my own fault i went past my limit lol \ Ha, at least it was good
I took my pup to the park last weekend and he had fun meeting other dogs and their owners! \ Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?
Yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol. He will go up to people and not leave until they pet him. \ Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.
Absolutely! What kind of dog do you have? \ He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.
I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day. \ Was it someone you know? Sorry for your loss if it was.
Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother. \ I'm sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?
I knew my dad was going to take care of me when I got the flu. He just wanted me to get better \ That was so nice of him. He sounds very caring.
He was a very good parent for sure \ You are very lucky!
I only have one semester left of college and the classes are going to be very difficult. \ I am sure you will get used to them
Yes I will. I can't wait to see final grades. I have no doubt I will be able to keep my 4.0 gpa average. \ That is a challenge, but thats not a bad thing
So I was drunk coming back from a party and woke up to find I peed the bed lol. First time in like 24 years. \ lol, it happens to us all
Yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something, at least I did lol. \ haha true
i felt dumb when I lost my receipt \ That sucks did you need to return something?
yes some printer ink \ That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.
My friend's dog died \ Oh man I am so sorry.  Had she had the dog for a long time?
She had him for over five years \ That is so sad.  My dog had congestive heart failure and died so I know how sad that can be
I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me \ Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of people's time
I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing \ Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait
Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying! \ Wow! I would write a review, and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!
So I was on the bus back from a party and a drunk guy barfed on me at a stop lol. Most of it got on my jacket and he didnt even apologize. \ Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?
Well I didn't want to start a fight or anything, so I just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride. Then I washed it like 6 times lol \ That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.
I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious. \ Good luck! What is it on?
Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.  \ How much studying did you do leading up to it?
I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan. \ Why didn't you go?
Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM! \ Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?
Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like.  \ Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?
yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again. \ You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!
I felt bad when I missed my friends wedding. I just did not have time to make it \ Although you felt bad, I am sure your friend would understand. 
He did eventually thankfully \ That is good. Everyone gets busy sometimes.
My friends want me to go scuba diving with them. \ That does sound fun
I don't really want to go because I worry about sharks and other creatures. \ I am sure there will be none of those there
I felt alone when my dad passed away. I just felt I had no one to turn to \ I am so sorry to hear that. Dealing with the loss of a loved one is always difficult but feeling alone in the grief must be so much worse. I hope that you are feeling less alone now.
I am, it took awhile but I got through it \ I am sure that it did. Were you very close with your father?
I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it! \ Oh man, I bet that will be fun
We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean? \ I have, I love going when I can
I can't wait for college in the fall! I left 2 years ago and am back feeling more confident in my studying abilities. \ i hope you do really well
Thanks anything youre looking forward to? \ going to see some old friends this weekend
i was happy with myself for working hard this week \ Good job what did you work hard on?
my job and at the gym \ Nice keep it up!
One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast! \ That's really nice of him! How long have you been married?
We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner! \ Well you made the right choice in man to marry lol. What kind of necklace?
It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean? \ That either sounds like a locket, or a heart shaped key. Am I close at all?
Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top \ Cool I think I saw a commercial for that actually.
I got back into college after 2 years off and I'm pretty proud of myself. \ That is awesome!  What are you studying
Ya thanks it's mechanical engineering I have 2 years left. \ was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?
Oh I am going back in a few weeks. It will probably be hard but I will enjoy it for sure. \ Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!
Im so proud of myself.  I started a new job today! \ Oh YAY congrats! You should be proud of yourself, that's a good accomplishment
I know.  I had my last job 5 years so it was hard to make myself quit and try something new. \ Yeah, people get comfortable even if they don't like it. It's sometimes good to try something new.
I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip. \ Ut oh.. what happened?
I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw. \ hehehe.. don't mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... don't feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.  Those people don't know you or really care.  They laugh like I did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear. 
I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone \ What are you going to do about it
I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution \ Well be careful for sure
4 \ I did not understand the number 4
Sorry, I meant I was excited when I got to go visit a potential college. It was somewhere I wanted to go \ Well ... I hope you like it and above all that you study something amazing
So last weekend it poured rain all day and I chilled at my house by myself. Pretty boring. \ I do like the rain though
It is relaxing, the only thing is that you can't do anything outside really. Had some plans but they got canceled. \ I am sure you will have plans again
That's true, it's good to look forward to the future. \ Yeah, I am sure it will be fine
I felt bad when I lied to my dad about where I was the night before. I was not sure he would understand \ It's something we've all done, dont feel bad. Would he have gotten mad?
I am not sure, I guess I was worried he would be \ If you dont mind me asking, where was it that you pretended to be?
At a friends house, I was with a girl though \ Ya we've all been there lol. Just be careful and all that, you'll be fine.
My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me. \ I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever talked to your parents about that?
I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel? \ Yes, you do.Otherwise, you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life.
I am so piss-of at Trump right now \ Oh wow, what aspect of his presidency is bothering you?
The whole collusion with Russia and the fact that he keeps underminding the FBI \ I can understand why that upsets you. Are you a Hillary Clinton supporter?
I just had a huge test in my Law class today. I won't know how I did until next week. \ Did you study hard for it?
I did and I am pretty sure that I aced it! \ That's awesome! Are you going to celebrate now or wait until the grades come in?
My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately. \ That is great that your hard work has paid off.
Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time! \ Now you having something to celebrate. Congrats!
I get a good feeling of the past when I hear a certain song. It makes me think of the past which was fun \ Mer to
Its a nice feeling \ yes, it it's.It's like a time machine.
I am very sad these days.On a deep funk. \ I am sorry, what are you sad about
My grandma died 5 weeks ago. I am still sad. \ I have been there. I guess just remember the good times
I stayed up until midnight and watched ESPN to see who would acquire him.  I thought he would end up staying in Cleveland. \ Do you mean LeBron James? I was hoping he'd come to Miami!
Yes I do!  Wow, if he went to Miami that would've been crazy!   \ I wish he would have! The Heat can use his help! Haha!
I was so shocked that my husband bought me tickets to see my favorite NFL team, the Steelers, in Jacksonville! \ That must've been awesome.  I've only been to one NFL game and it was wild!
The game is in November! I've never been to an NFL game! I was so shocked that he bought the tickets! \ I can imagine!  I remember finding out I got free tickets to Disney World one time, I was ecstatic.
I saw a dude driving a Porsche down the street of my city. Was definitely jealous lol \ I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.
Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure. \ Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous, and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).
I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me. \ Dont worry, anyone would have felt the same way. If it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once.
I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational. \ Yeah thats important, did you have music you could have listened to or something?
I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty. \ Loyalty is a good thing
Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though. \ Oh wow, that is loyalty for sure
I knew I was going to get into a school that I wanted. I just worked hard for it to happen \ That's awesome! Congratulations! Are you in college?
No it was awhile back, but its a good memory \ That is a wonderful memory. What school did you attend?
My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady. \ I wish I had a grandma.. did she send you anything extra?
I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income. \ That is still really sweet.  I never knew any of mine.  Treasure her while you can!
I can't wait till next week.  School starts on Monday. \ That's great! Are you in school or teaching?
Both actually.  Im a teacher but I am taking a class on the side too. \ That's awesome! I am currently in college myself. I actually just finished two summer courses today. Not going to lie though, I could use a bit of a break before the fall semester begins.
A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed. \ Wow, must have been rather frightening. Glad you are ok!
Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended. \ I hope you have all the emergency essentials you need for next time.
I am waiting to hear back on how well I did on my college entrance exams. \ Oh wow! I am sure that you did great! Did you just finish high school?
No but going back to school late. \ I can relate to that. I went into the military after high school, and I am currently in college. It was a bit overwhelming getting back into the state of mind required for school, but it is all worth it! What school are you hoping to attend?
Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy \ Gardening can be peaceful
Especially when you feel something special by nature \ Nature is a wonderful thing
I was sad when I had to give away my dog. The place I was going to did not allow animals \ It's hard to make this decision ... I'm sorry ... What's your pet's name?
Omar was his name \ Omar sure will have some new owners who will love it
My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her. \ Oh how exciting!  What do you have planned?
We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years. \ I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?
Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure. \ Well I'm sure everything will go great!
Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that! \ yeah that's tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?
Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache. \ That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. 
I miss my grand parents so much. \ Why don't you see them anymore?
Yes.They are both deceased.We used to go to their ranch every other weekend when  I was a kid. \ Aww, the best thing you can do is keep them alive through your memories.
Yesterday, I ate a whole pizza by myself! \ I take you don't have issued with you weight.
No, I just did it because nobody thought I could. \ Ok, then.If it was a 1 thing only, no problem.
I am so happy these days. \ Why are you happy
I just got the promotion of my life at work. \ Oh wow, are you excited
I could not wait for the first day of college. I was just ready for it \ I remember that feeling myself back on my first day of college
Yeah, Its a nice feeling to have \ The first years is the best
So i finally fully own my car now! \ Congratulations! That is exciting
so many years of budgeting i even had to sell one of my computers once. \ but it's over now :) what kind of car?
Honda Pilot 2014 still runs like a dream luckily. \ that's a good car 
I hugged a random woman at the store today... \ I bet that was pretty awkward.
very. I guess she is a twin I never knew \ Did the woman say anything to you?
I feel kinda bad.  I took something that didn't belong to me \ Oh no what did you take?
I took 20 bucks out of my boyfriends wallet. LOL. \ Did you tell him about it at least?
I got a wonderful surprise the other day. \ I love surprises.  What was it?
My husband picked out a few different shirts and told me to pick one of them and be ready by noon. He took me on the most wonderful date. \ Nice!  Where did he take you?
My apartment was robbed. I was totaly devastated by seeing the damages and what was stolen. \ Wow I am so sorry. That had to be so scary.  Were the cops able to find any evidence?
No, they were totaly useless \ man I was hoping they would be able to help in some way!  I hope they didn't take anything to personal!
Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary! \ Did he do anything to you and your mom?
Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary! \ I am glad that nothing happened.
In order try to get a friend to break up with her jerk boyfriend, I sent him fake texts that looked like they were from another woman. \ Oh wow! Did it work?
No, and it made her feel horrible because she thought that she wasn't enough for him.  In the end, it wasn't worth it. \ I bet you felt really bad. Did you end up telling her the truth?
My grandma was very sick and unable to get around very easily.  \ I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone who's there to help her?
No, so I decided to go stay with her so that I could take care of her until she was better. \ That was nice of you.  My parents did the same with my grandparents.  She's very fortunate to have you.
Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early. \ Oh wow, I have heard that can happen with that food
Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe' \ Ha, that is funny
I was upset when I picked up my drunk friend. He was just being a pain \ I am sorry to hear; drunk people can make a situation quite difficult to deal with. Have you been friends for long?
We have, I got over it, but at the time it was painful \ I can understand that. You sound like a good friend.
So i found out my dad was cheating on my mom for 3 years. \ Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. Does your mom know?
Yeah she is the one that told me. Apparently she managed to make him break it off finally. \ I am so sorry that your family is going through this horrible time. Is your dad unwilling to end the affair?
I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever! \ ewww! that is just super gross dude!
I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially! \ Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.
I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding! \ I would love to have that tv
Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do? \ Keep it, the guilt will go away
I was nervous when I had to go to jury duty. I just did not want to go \ I can understand your apprehension. Have you ever served on jury duty before?
No, I had no idea what to expect \ I have never served on jury duty either. The closest thing that I have experienced was serving as a guard during a military court martial.
it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat. \ Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.
Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up. \ Exactly, sometimes I think women like drama.
This guy at school keeps following me around. He followed me all day yesterday. I think he want's to be my friend. \ Is he acting creepy at all? 
It's getting to that point. I wish he would just stop. I have enough friends already. \ Have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?
My daughter is the best.I am so proud of her. \ What did she accomplish?
She just got accepted  in Harvard. \ WOW... that is a biggie!
You know... I have never cheated on my husband, or anyone else for that matter. \ Good for you.You are a person with morals.
Thank you.  Can't say it never crossed my mind but I behave! \ We all have thinking that sometimes, but acting is the wrong thing to do.
Im proud of my dogs behaing around new visitors \ That's good you have well-behaved dogs, did you train them?
Not on purpose, but they have learned from right and wrong from me \ Well it's good you're doing something right.
It's tough seeing my dog get old and have trouble walking now. \ Oh mine too, he is 12 and lost eye sight
It's unfortunate, mine just turned 15. \ Wow, 15 cant do nothing but love them
One time I got picked over for a job, it was a real bummer. \ were you qualified ?
Yeah, in fact I felt a bit overqualified for the job. And the person who it was eventually given to did not have the same or even equal quality qualifications. \ its all apart of life sometimes
my sister won a small loterry and she gifted me 500 bucks \ That was really lucky! And also very nice of your sister. What'd you do with the case?
i just used it to trim some trees in my backyard that was long overdue \ That's really great. Are the trees really tall where you live?
So i was told yesterday while i've been away my pet turtle had died. :( \ That's terrible! Did he at least live a good life?
He did live for 12 years but apparently i wasn't told til now and he died 2 weeks ago. \ Oh man! Be sure to give em a proper sendoff. 
I always feel so bad when I see my other friends with new clothes. I wish I could have clothes that weren't purchased at a thrift store... \ I don't think having designer brand is all that great.
It's not. I'm just tired of feeling like everyone looks so much cooler than me. \ Why does being cool matter though? Wouldn't you rather just be yourself?
So when i went to New York for business i had this kid behind me on the plane. \ Oh yeah.. what happened?
Kid half way through the flight started to kick on my seat. \ That is the worst.. I've had that happen to me before!
My friend just got a brand new house.. and I feel like a loser because I am still in an apartment. \ It is nice to have your own place. Think about just being able to do whatever you want. You can just punch your walls if you want.
I can't though I live in a 1 bedroom apartment.  Cries... \ It's ok just think about it this way. You don't have to pay property taxes or even be worried about your lawn.
My husband and I went to dinner tonight and were looking at pictures of our kids when they were really little. \ How sweet! How old are they now?
They are 18 and almost 16, they say the days go by so slow but the years fly by - and they are right.  I can't believe they are not that little anymore. \ This is true for me as well, I have a 17 and 19 years old. I can't believe it, and just turned 40 on the 5th.
I scored a 95 on my promotion exam, I was upset that I missed one question. \ But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!
Thank you, I am definitely proud! When was your last exam? \ Oh, it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)
I had real fear when a tornado was close to where I was living. I thought I could due \ do you live in the midwest
I live in the southeast. \ do you have an emergency shelter in your basement ?
my neighbor has this big old dog that keeps pooping huge poops on my driveway \ I hate that, did you ask them to stop
the owners don't care, they said yes they will keep the dog inside but never do \ That isnt good, sorry
The other day I went on a airplane and had a panic attack the whole time. I'm not good with heights. \ Oh no! What did you do to bring yourself down? (from the panic attack)
I had to cover my head with a blanket, and picture myself somewhere else. That's how bad it was. \ I'm sorry. That sounds bad. Flying always makes me nervous but I usually make it ok.
I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic. \ It must have been fun to catch up with them.
it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup. \ Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.
I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done. \ Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.
Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous! \ That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
My daughter is going to be a senior in high school this year. I am so excited for her. \ That's fantastic! Senior year can be such a fun experience! I hope that she enjoys it. Is she going to take a senior trip?
I don't know if her class will take one. We are going on a cruise for the first time during Spring Break with my whole family. I can't wait to see what the future holds for her. \ That sounds exciting! I went on my first cruise in March; we had a blast!
I don't have a lot of friends. \ Well we are friends aren't we? I do appreciate you as one.
Thanks. In my mom's group, I feel like a lot of the moms are friends but I'm not friends with any of them. \ You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.
So man i had my friend john come back to town. He's looking for a house and last i check he didn't have a job. but apparently he got a job and runs a business now. \ Oh wow, he must be proud of himself!
I am really surprised but overall impressed really. \ That is some feat, I wish I could do that!
So i am really mad right now. Brother took my car without asking and i have to go to work. \ That would really upset me! How are you going to get to work?
I dunno all my friends are busy and no one is even answering the phone at work. \ Can you take an uber?
I was in a small fender bender earlier this week. Now I am scared that I will be in an even worse wreck. \ Oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and don't think about it.
I hope so. I am driving and I just get so scared.  \ Just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.
I was nervous last night during a storm. I hate when it rains hard \ It can be scary, my sister's in-laws' house got struck by lightning recently.
Oh wow, was everyone okay \ I think so, not sure how the house is.
I had to get my foot checked out at the doctor recently, always makes me nervous. \ I am sure you will be okay

Yeah me and my dog watched TV.. but still I go crazy sometimes being alone. \ I understand.
I took my son out and did a bunch of nice stuff for him.  He was great until we got to naptime. \ Naptime is a good thing though isnt it
It is but he threw a huge temper tantrum at naptime.  \ Well that is never good
I could not wait for this past Christmas. I was seeing family that I had not seen in a long time \ Did you have a great Christmas then?
It was very nice \ Holidays are always a nice time to get together. 
I want backpacking in the woods last summer. I had a great time but it was strange not seeing any other person for over a week. \ Sometimes being alone can be a good thing though
Yeah it was just a bit eerie without any human interactions. I actually missed having someone to talk to. \ Well I am sure it was a good experience
I got to see my favorite band last night. They were good \ Oh that is pretty neat. Who is your favorite band anyway?
Deftones, they have been around for awhile \ Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called "Change". It is so good.
I was alone last summer when all of my friends were gone. It just felt like I had no one to hang with \ That would be discouraging.  Did you make new friends?
Not at point.  \ That's no fun. Hopefully you got some stuff done around the house then.
For mother's day, my son had to fill out a paper in school that asked a bunch of questions.  \ That doesnt sound too fun
I read it when he got home and alot of his responses involved mommy said a bad word! \ Oh wow, the kid is a snitch

I tried OkCupid last year for the first time...the first girl I met was decent in the pictures, but turned out to be a bombshell in person... \ I do not like OkCupid.
Okay buddy what do you like \ I prefer Tinder.
I had the longest day of work in my life. \ Oh no.. why what happened?
Well it's not a bad thing. I was up for 48 hours and i get 2 weeks of paid days off now though. \ Thats awesome!  I am tired too I had to be up early today.
I came home today and my whole house was clean..  \ Oh! that is pretty nice to come home too.
My boyfriend really did a lot of chores while I was gone!  I couldn't believe my eyes LOL. \ You better keep him sounds like a keeper.
I am proud of my dad. He got to retire earlier than expected \ thats so great! i love my dad too
Yeah I was really happy for him \ thats really awesome
i was upset i woke up so late today \ It happens, everyone does it
yeah thats true, not the end of the world; \ I am sure you will fix it
Least year I took my final performance exam for my pilot's license.  I thought it was going to be easy.  I was wrong. \ Oh man I bet that is a very difficult test. I can't believe how many instruments are in a cockpit!
I didn't even make it to the airplane.  The examiner wasn't happy with a few of my answers in the oral exam.  I could have sworn I had studied enough! \ What a bummer. At least now you know what you need to study for when you take the exam again!
My birthday was last week. I had to work and was bummed when it seemed like no one even knew it was my big day. \ That's unfortunate.  Did the people you work with by any chance surprise you?  Please say yes!
Well in the afternoon all of a sudden I heard everyone singing Happy Birthday and my manager brought a cake over with candles! I was so surprised and happy! \ Blow out them candles and make a wish!

It was a nice college \ Oh cool I bet he had to work really hard to get his degree. I am sure he appreciated your support.
My kids left for college last summer. I got teary when they got in the car to leave. I was thinking about how quick their childhood had gone by. \ I have those kinds of feelings as well. I think memories are a good thing though
It was rough for me because I have so many memories of them growing up. Now I miss them so much! \ I can understand that for sure, just remember the good ones
I was happy when I got to stay at a cabin last weekend. It felt like home \ That sounds really nice!  Did you enjoy yourself and relax?
It was so relaxing, I needed it \ It is a good feeling when you get to just relax and feel laid back.
I am going to my first haunted house this October! I don't know why I feel so scarred! \ Ha, that will be fun though
I hope so because as of right now, I feel like a chicken! \ Ha, I bet it will be fine
For the last couple years I had a crush on a girl I knew from high school. I saw her recently with her boyfriend. \ That must have felt sort of defeating.  There is still hope if there isn't a ring on her finger!
Well it was rough for me to see her with another guy. I was hoping that we could have dated. Now I think about them together and get so jealous. \ Try not to feel that way.  If it was meant to be, it would have happened.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea!
I was cleaning out my attic and stumbled upon my old Star Wars action figures! Going through them really brought back some good memories! \ Oh wow that is awesome. I remember when those came out. Everyone wanted to have one!
Yeah, I had like 40  of them.  Those were the good old days! \ It's crazy how many toys they have now. Disney is really pushing the merchandise out!

A supervisor I didn't like got fired \ Thats great! But what did they do that you didn't like?
He and I never got along, seemed like he tried to sabotage me \ Well looks like that didn't work out for him in the end. What finally got him axed?
Man you won't believe what happened. Some kid rammed his quad into my garage door \ How'd he do that?
Was driving out in the field and fell off. Didn't attach the thingy that is supposed to kill the engine when you fall. And the rest is physics I suppose. \ Sounds like a mess, how much did it cost to replace?
I wish I was Brad Pitt. \ I wish i was Chris Pratt but why do you wanna be "The Pitt"

My wife and I spent hours all during the weekend to get the house clean. \ That's always a pain! It can take forever but never lasts long enough
I was so sad last summer when my dog ran away. I thought I would never see him again. \ Man, that is so sad.  I don't know what I would do if my dog ran away!  Did you ever find him?
Well one day a stranger knocked on my door. I thought I was dreaming when I saw they had my dog with them. I was so happy they had brought Fido home! \ That's awesome!  I love a happy ending!
I had to hire a plumber last week for a leak in my kitchen sink. Everything was great until I saw the bill. Talk about sticker shock! \ Yeah those guys sure charge a lot. They know they are needed for emergencies, hah!
That's what I was thinking.  They already did the work, so I had to just deal with it.  The price sure blew my mind though.  He must have used gold pipes! \ That is a trade that can get very messy. I respect guys that get arm-deep in sewage lol!
i felt upset about losing my friend's blu ray i borrowed \ Did you replace it?
not yet im still looking for it \ Do you think he'll get angry?
I was walking down the sidewalk at night and thought I saw someone following me \ did you start walking faster?

No, she just did it out of the blue. It was a little kitten! I had no idea she was bringing it home. \ I hope a nice surprise.
I was mislead by a worker who wanted to undermine my work. I had a high estime toward his co worker before this. \ That's always hard to deal with. What did he do?
He gave wrong data in purpose. This resulted in me presenting wrong results to our IT director. \ I'm sorry he did that to you. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding.
My neighbors really look out for each other \ That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so?
They always holding hands and smiling \ Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.

I was driving to the store yesterday when some yahoo cut me off. They almost hit my car. \ did you give them the finger ?

i do  not like dogs since they chased me when i was a kid and bit mre \ That must have been really scary. Maybe you like cats instead?
they were strays \ Oh I see. Did you get tested to see if they had any diseases? Strays sometimes have rabies.
I almost hit a deer driving down the highway a few days ago. \ Wow, thank goodness you didnt hit it, for youre sake and the deer
Indeed, I had to swerve around though and I think I messed up one of my tires. \ That can happen, Ive seen deer walk across a highway
I loaned my neighbor some money. Hopefully he pays it back today \ I would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward.
Yes thats true, to say the least \ I hope it wasn't too much money just in case.
I got a email from a distant relative recently that said they needed surgery but couldn't afford the bill. I was so worried they would die. \ Oh my goodness, that is terrible.  They don't have insurance?
Then my cousin sent another email saying the relative was hacked by scammers and don't send any money. I was glad to hear my relative is doing fine! \ I was just about to mention that you should be careful that its not a scam of some sort.
Lady backed into my car the other day and proceeds to tell me she doesn't have insurance. \ Oh my. That would really tick me off. In my state they will lose their license for that.
I had just bought the car two days before the accident. \ Well I hope your insurance company sues them. They should really be more responsible.
When I fail at school I get so mad. \ Why do you fail? Do you not study?
I do study but I am not smart. \ No one is smart until they learn to be smart. We are all born with brains but not smarts. We must gain smarts.
On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car. \ I love the Autobahn.
I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast. \ Yes I use to own an Audio.

I cleaned the refridgerator out the other day and I found something that had gone very very bad. \ Oh that's never a good situation. It happens to the best of us though. I need to clean my fridge
I put it off too long this time. It was pretty stinky, my dogs thought I was nuts for throwing food away.  \ I'm sure they were thinking waste not, want not. haha
Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window. \ Oh wow, sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?
By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed. \ Did you have any damage to your home?
I lost my wallet the other day and my neighbor returned it. \ Whoa, that is a good neighbor. I hope you return the favor some time!
I know! I was looking for it all day yesterday. Turns out it was at the top of a tree!. \ Dang. I bet there is a great story of how it got there!
My son had prepared so hard for his piano recital last week. He had nerves but did so good and everyone clapped when he was done. \ Dang. Did she practice a lot leading up to the recital?

I can't believe my 25th anniversary high school reunion is around the corner. \ Oh wow. Do you think you are going to go?
Yes. With all the family graduations this year it has really gotten me all sentimental about mine. \ That's pretty neat. Where is it at?
I went to the bowling alley all alone yesterday because my friends ditched me. \ That sucks!  Bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport 
Yeah, none of my friends wanted to go for some reason. I was so sad and alone. \ You should join a league and meet some friends with similar interests.
Last week at work I kept hearing people laughing when I walked by. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at. \ That's odd. Were they laughing about you?

I am getting married tomorrow. So pumped! \ Whoa I hope you guys have a great honeymoon. Make sure to treat your fiancee right!
Oh I will! It isn't to hard to please a siberian tiger. Ordering her from Russia was very difficult. \ Well as long as you have a safe word you should be OK. You also may want to buy some life insurance.
I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely. \ That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?
No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed \ I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?
5 \ what do you mean by 5?

My dog threw up on my $10,000 tuxedo that I purchased with my lottery winnings. \ That's awful!

I was almost hit head on by a driver that was texting, I hate people like that! \ That's terrible! How did it feel when it happened? Were you mad?
I was terrified and so angry! \ I would be too. Hopefully you channeled your rage to let him know who is king of the road.
I am getting my first car tomorrow. I am so pumped! \ It is very nice. Where would you go first with your new car?
I think I will go to McDonald's to buy 50 Big Macs to really infuse it with that nasty, greasy smell of despair. \ Nice
I mislead a coworker to undermine his work. I feel bad about it. \ That's terrible. Are you guys still friends?
Not anymore. \ That's so sad. Perhaps you should buy him a cake and beg for his forgiveness.
I went to the park to read a book yesterday. \ That sounds so relaxing.  What book did you read?
I read "The Cat and the Hat"! It is a very intellectual and soothing book. \ ha ha ha.  Its a good book for sure!

That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again. \ You should. When is the next one.
I hate to be tired and see a store crowded with customers and only one or two checkouts open. \ Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on. 
Especially when it's a time of day that they know will be crowded and busy. \ Exactly. Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster. 
There was a person who had to do twice the amount of work that they usually do. Sounded like they need to fire whoever didn't do their job  \ Yeah, or at least do something to correct that.
Maybe there should be a training day where they do back over everything,  \ or hire more people maybe also
That too! If only \ They don't spend money unless they absolutely have to. They get bonuses for saving money I think
My neighbor returned my longsword to me this morning after a heated battle with the adjacent neighborhood. \ Did he do any damage?
He did! He cut those ingrates down like they were wheat! I was quite thankful. \ Is the sword in one piece?
I was reading through some old school papers \ Oh yeah? Find anything interesting?
It made me think about how far I've come since.  I also felt like I was in a different time and place reading them \ Ah, nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times.

You mean other than than dim sum? \ Dim Sum specifically
My friends went out to a party \ Are you going, too?
They didn't invite me for some reason \ Oh no, that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?

I wish he'd pick up after himself \ Does he do that stuff often?
Got a coupon for free coffee. It's not much, but $5 is $5. \ What kind of coffee will you get?
A large caramel frappe with whip cream. It's delicious. \ Are the coffees there expensive?
I have a total trust in our current gouvernment. I think that they handled very well the tax war that Trump has started \ I agree with you. I think everything will be fine in the end.
Yes, I think so \ It's good to see that you have a positive attitude about it like me.
My husband wants to go parasailing together when we go to Mexico next month. \ That is very nice thing to do.
I am not sure I want to though. I'm worried that the cord will snap or something. \ I understand. You are over the water. Nothing bad could happened.
I was busy with a work related project \ Oh? What kind of project?
Presentation, a co-worker came in and helped me out \ Oh that's nice of them! 
I'm so glad we have cell phones now as my friend accidentally left my apartment with an important document. \ What was the document?
It was an important blueprint for software I am designing for a client. My boss would not have been happy if I left it \ I would imagine he'd be pretty upset
Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. \ How did you feel?
I was quite annoyed, especially because it was unnecessary too. \ What kind of car was it?
I put in extra hours at work \ That's good, do you get paid over time?
Yeah, I would like for my boss to notice and promote me at some point \ I think if you keep it up you'll get the recognition you want soon.
I am mortified. I was going to the bank and tried to open the door. I kept pulling and pulling until I realized I was supposed to push. Unfortunately, a bunch of people saw me. \ I had a similar experience the other day at the gas station. It's terrible when that stuff happens.
I wish nobody had seen my.  There was no good way to play it off. \ Yeah but people are only amused because something they fear is happening to someone else. Those people don't matter and it's happened to everyone
This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from. \ Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?
Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky. \ Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!
My friend never got back to me about our vacation plans \ oh. was it cancelled?
No, he just hasn't helped make plans yet and I thought he really wanted to go. I guess he doesn't anymore \ Just ask him. Or you can make the plans
I just visited just my best friend the other day. \ Oh? Did you have fun?
I was upset because she bought a new tv and it is huge. I always wanted a big tv like that. \ Ah, I've never really been into big TVs. I have a tiny one that's good enough for me!
My son had his wisdom teeth pulled today so I'm doing whatever I can for him while he rests up. \ Has he been needy?
No, he's been sleeping mostly. \ How long do you think it'll take for him to recover?
I was taking a stroll at night and saw a group of guys up ahead \ Was everything okay? What were they doing?
I ended up turning around, who knows what they were up to \ True, you never know these days.
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet \ Is your phone waterproof?
My case was, as the phone still worked \ You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...
I ate a box of donuts yesterday when I promised myself I wouldn't cheat on my diet. I am so let down on myself \ It happens, sounds like you need to remove all the bad food from your home
I know, but the temptation is always there for me. I'm pretty sure I have discipline issues. \ Maybe ask a friend to help keep you in check
I cried all day when my grandma died. \ I'm sorry to hear that. You two were close?
Yes. I visited her every summer. \ I did the same with mine. I lived with her during the summers and went home when school started back.
Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back. \ Oh wow thats cool.
Yes, he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long.  \ Thats good you still think of him.
A giant wasp tried to attack me on my balcony. Another reason why I don't like to go on my balcony! \ Wow. Did you call the police?
