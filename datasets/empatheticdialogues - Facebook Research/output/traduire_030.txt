It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks.  \ Well that should relieve some stress
I was shocked when my aunt came to my graduation, She lived far away \ Oh wow, you must have been thrilled!
I was very happy for sure \ That's great when someone you love puts in the extra effort to be there for you
My daughter didnt have a good first year at her new school. \ Thats not good, I remember bad times at school. What happened?
She didnt make a lot of friends. She is shy \ One good friend who you can trust is better than a bunch you can't. It's just part of growing up sometimes. School can be an exercise in mental strength.
Thats what I told her. This year is going to be better \ Yes, I hope she can find her self worth in who she is. It's just part of growing up. It's hard
The birds in my neighborhood all gather on my fence if I haven't feed them that day. \ What kind of birds are they?
All kinds, Wrens, sparrows, blue  jays, wood peckers.  I feel very protective and cannot help but take care of them. I will feel sad when I move. I like feeding all critters \ Thats so sweet of you.
I was nervous when starting a new school. I knew no one \ That can be one of the hardest parts of life. Very tough
Yeah it was very tough \ How did it go? Is it college?
I am very upset and a bit disgusted by that the person I live with still doesn't like paying bills. You have to pay bills to have things \ I am sorry, roommates can be annoying sometimes
Not a roomate lol-but yes. That's how life works though. If you want things and luxuries, they cost money. I'll never understand entitled people. \ I will not either
My sister has been begging me to go to a new haunted museum with her. \ Ah! That's kind of a scary thought, but I bet that would also be kind of fun. I live in a city with a very extensive history that is utilized a lot in "haunted" trips and stuff like that, so I have seen them around and have wondered about going on one. Do you believe in ghosts?
They scare me enough that I guess I do believe. I don't want to go because I fell like I will get freaked out and have bad dreams. \ Yeah, I can totally understand that. It can be exhilarating and a different experience, I would imagine. But I would understand that you wouldn't want to have to deal with the after effects. I never have trouble with nightmares, so I don't worry about that. As for me, I'm still on the fence about ghosts.
My girlfriend has been so busy with work lately, it's left me feeling neglected. But she's working hard to pay off her student loans and to build her savings, so I have to respect that. But at the same time, we're long distance, so the time I have with her when she actually isn't working isn't that fulfilling, either. \ That's really too bad. I know how that feels. Have you tried telling her how you feel about it?
Yeah, we've had multiple conversations. But it always comes back to her not being able to budge on the time she can commit to her job. And with the long distance thing, there's less of an immediate necessity for her to change her commitment. It's a work in progress. \ That must be really difficult and lonely for you. I hope you guys can get something figured out.
I am really glad to see how hard my son is working \ Sounds like a good kid. What has he been working on.
He got his first job and he has been really responsible with it and it has been 4 months \ That's great! How old is he?
We finished painting most of my brother's room today. I think we'll be able to get his room done well before he comes back next weekend. \ That is nice of you.  Where has he been?
Away for college. He's been sounding stressed lately, so we thought we'd redo his room to surprise him. \ that is really nice of you
I got in a bit of an altercation with a co-worker today, and I'm afraid it may lead to me losing my job. It started with a misunderstanding,and when they didn't want to simply accept that it was a misunderstanding after I apologized, I decided to simply defend myself and there was a verbal back-and-forth witnessed by a few people. This is not the image I wanted to have at my job... \ Sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself.
Yeah. I didn't want to seem like a whiny brat, but I didn't want to seem like a pushover either, especially when I thought it was stupid to fight about it to begin with. If I lose my job, it won't be the worst thing, since it's just a part-time job to get me through college. But I still hate the feeling that I let people down, or that I look dumb in other people's eyes. \ If they know you, they should know better.
A possom was waiting outside my door. \ Talk about an unwelcome guest! I would have immediately slammed my door shut! I never know how to respond in those situations, as in whether or not they're dangerous, etc. What did you do?
He seem harmless enough, so I gave him some food. \ I did not expect that kind of reaction! But I guess I don't know enough about possums. Maybe that makes sense. I compare them almost to raccoons, who I've seen be very aggressive. Well, it looks you made a new friend. I hope you named them!
I pray I make the soccer team this year. \ I'm sure you will. Have you been training? 
Yes, everyday for two hours. \ Do you think that's enough?
Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas. \ Did you fart?
It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time.  \ Did they smell?
I had lost my iPad in an airport a week ago, and even though it had my contact information, I wasn't sure it'd be returned to me. I just figured it was gone for. But it showed up today, in the same condition! \ You are so lucky!
Yeah, I know! I feel like I need to go buy a lottery ticket or something. I had already started looking online for replacements, and it came in today. Things like that restore your faith in humanity, as stupid as that sounds. I mean, it's just an iPad. I'm lucky to even have one. So, I did feel a little childish getting that sad over it. \ I know exactly what you mean. Someone returned my purse at the casino once. It still had my money in it!
I am still goin to court for child support. \ That must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with. To constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support, and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head. You have to be really resilient to go through that.
Its been ten years and it doesnt even show up half of the time. I told the judge the last time I don't even want it anymore. \ Wow.. That's almost noble. I hope you're able to still properly survive without it, especially since it's unfair that you're not getting it in the first place. I'm sorry you're being put in that position. One day I'm sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them.
I was aggravated at myself when I failed my science test. I could have done more \ Don't be too hard on yourself. You taught yourself a lesson for next time.
Yeah, I will do better next time for sure \ I'm in college I understand. Just have to keep pushing forward and you'll so great
The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right. \ Everyone has those kinds of days, it happens
It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.  \ I am sure they have forgotten about it
I have to deal with an entitled person lately and I can't stand it.  \ Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you're near a snob.
Oh man...SO TRUE! It really makes me want to be nasty. Behaving like a dictator is not acceptable from even a dictator! \ Seriously!  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesn't always means they are better than me just because they are entitled.  As they say, everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time.
I got a ticket today for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign. So I stopped but they didn't think it was long enough. Ridiculous. \ Ugh! So you have corrupt police officers in your town too? That is a bummer!
Yes.  I'm a great driver with a perfect record but did I get a warning?  No.  I got a ticket but I'm going to contest it in court.   \ I would too! Most officers dont show up for that.
My mom is doing her best to put me through college on her own. She raised me and my brother by herself, and while doing so she put enough aside to cover a chunk of my college expenses somehow. I guess she invested some of they money her grandparents left her, and it turned out to really pay off. She surprised me with this and I had no idea she was going to do that. I don't deserve her. \ Your mom is awesome
She is! I try to tell her as much as I can. But she's very humble, so she doesn't pay attention to it. I've been trying to strategize on ideas of how I can properly show her that I appreciate all that she's done. It feels like everything would be too little a sentiment. \ Maybe you should go on a trip together
MY kids are my favorite people in the world. \ Oh yeah? That sounds awesome. That's how it should be! Can you tell me a little bit about them?
Two girls and one boy.  I want them to live with me forever. Their kids too lol \ Haha, that's incredible. A lot of parents wouldn't feel that way... After 18, they're done. That's pretty cool of you to feel that way, but I guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are. It sounds like you raised them right.
I don't like to go shopping at big stores. \ Why is that?
I feel panicked. I don't like being around a lot of people at once. I wish I didn't feel that way but I just don't like big stores and lots of people. \ I can understand that
I am hoping my brother is going to make my birthday. He can get busy though with work \ I hops so too! Work does come first or the bills can't be paid! :)
Yeah that is true sadly \ What kind of birthday are you having?
I just accomplished one of my biggest dreams and I feel like things are just perfect right now. \ Wow! Enjoy it! What did you accomplish if I may ask?
I just bought my dream house at the beach!  I'm moving there next week! \ That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats
Well I am in a relationship kind of..but they are away and I can't talk to them so I am quite lonely.  \ I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again?
It depends on what they do in therapy. I cannot live with them they way they have been so it's a pickle. \ That is so sad to hear.  I hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon.
I've owned 3 birds in the past 10 years and my 3rd bird just died last night. I didn't realize how much it would crush me. They were my buddies. \ There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. I'm sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone, I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names, if you don't mind me asking?
Thank you.  That's so sweet of you to say.  They were parakeets named Snowball, Curacoa, and Panda.  I think the best thing for me to do is get another one soon to continue to enjoy their sweet personalities. \ Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea, as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void, but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. She's already getting nervous since her dog is 10-years-old.
My significant other woke up last night with... a roach inside of her ear! She was complaining about pain in her ear, and a head ache that was incredibly severe. So, we took her to the doctor and he saw it with a light... and put water in her ear to get it out. Disgusting! \ Oh gross!  I've heard of flies or ants being in an ear, but a roach?  That gives me chills because I hate roaches sooooo much.  Now I might have nightmares tonight!
I'm sorry! I didn't mean for that. Yeah, some smaller ones--heck, even bigger ones, can get up there. And then they get stuck, and they freak out, so they're essentially just biting the inside of your head to try and get out. It's horrible to think about, and I've been trying to comfort her since when it happened a little bit ago. But she's getting over it soon. The weird thing is we don't even really ever see bugs in our house, so it was kind of like a one in a million thing. I bet she sleeps with ear plugs in her eyes for the next few years though... \ EW!  I might start sleeping with ear plugs in now too.  I've heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime, some in your sleep.  So many things to be scared of with bugs! I'm so glad they were able to get it out.  Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay.
Grocery shopping today was the worst \ Oh, how come?
I filled the cart, got to the register. and I had left my purse at home \ Oh my god! I have done something similar before. I don't get embarrassed easy but I know such things do sting a bit!
I was a bit irritated when the police bothered me the other night when I was simply walking. They do this a lot here. \ That is terrible
I know right? I can't wait to move. Seems like I can't ever go walking at night without them rolling up as if they don't have a million other things to do. \ Police here do that sometimes. It sucks.
It can be hard to wake up sometimes when you live alone. \ I can imagine that. I've never lived alone before.
Wow really? I have before and now I am again. It's hard! You wake up and think..what is going on, where am I..Oh yeah! \ When did you start living by yourself?
Just got a new job after being without one for a couple months now. \ That is great! Being without a job can be very scary
Thank you. Yea. It was very scary and stressful. \ What kind of job is it?
The mechanic who came to fix our air conditioner overcharged us by $200 \ Yu should report him
Who would I report him to? I did write a bad Yelp review. \ Well thats what I mean. I hate when people take advantage of others
I got all the classes I wanted this semester \ Oh that could be tough sometimes. I'm glad you were able to get all the ones you wanted.
Yep. Last semester I wasnt so lucky \ It's all behind you now.
I cried when my brother died. \ I'm so sorry. That must have been so painful for you. Were you close?
Yes, he was my best friend. \ My heart hurts for you. That's such a terrible loss.
I was so irked when I took my car in for an oil change last week!! \ Is it ok?
Yes, it's fine but the salesman tried insisting it required a bunch of unnecessary things, like synthetic oil which costs twice as much. I know for a fact, that was a lie. \ I do not like salesman.
My new neighbors just moved in, and they are around my age. Hope we can be friends. \ My neighbors are terrible so I hope you have a good relationship
Oh I've got terrible neighbors, too. I know that feeling. I hope these are a lot better. \ I actually had some move in a couple of days ago. I have figured them out yet lol
Sometimes I just love sitting around doing nothing \ That is doing something. It's what we call relaxing.
I guess you're right lol \ Have you been busy lately?
I went by my old school, and so much has changed. \ That happens over time
Yea, it does. Took me a moment to recognize the place. \ I wonder what my old school looks like now
My electric bill is twice as high as last month \ Oh no, what happened?
I have no idea. i am so mad \ You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity.
I asked my roomie if he wanted cake, and he said no. Turns out he ate all my cake. \ That's terrible, what did you do?
I called him out on it. \ I hope he learned his lesson.
I went to an Italian restaurant for dinner earlier. \ How was it?
I thought it was pretty good, not the greatest but good enough. \ What did you order?
There's nothing like being in your house after all your relatives have left after coming over for a long weekend visit. It's nice to see them, but once the frenetic energy is done with and you can kick your feet up... it's rewarding \ yes! Yin and yang, it's hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud :)
I'm glad to have seen them and caught up with them, and to hear what they've been up to. But man does it get annoying to deal with the crowd and the mess. And plus the extra money spent to feed them! Well, I have six months until I see them again. \ Remember to cherish them as we can all go at any minute :)
I am looking forward to getting a new vacuum on Tuesday. \ Oh, I love cleaning, so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed. What kind of brand?
I'm going with a Hoover. Yes I love things clean!  I haven't bought a new vacuum in years. It's long overdue. \ A Hoover seems like a reliable choice. My girlfriend is a neat freak, and decided to go with a big purchase, a Dyson, which is more expensive. I've used it and it's not bad. Still not sure I'd pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner, but who am I to argue. Anyway, I'm happy for you.
 I almost got hit by a semi truck today on the highway. It scared me half to death. \ Woah! I'm soooo glad you're okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can.
I know, I always try to, but my wife was in labor so she was making me pass everyone on the road. \ Well, that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?
My son has been having stomach pain for months now and the doctors can't figure out what it is. They basically say he has to get worse for them to find a diagnosis if some new problem comes up. I'm so scared. \ I completely understand that.  Things are always scary when it is happening to your kids, but there is hope!  Have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet?  Or doctor Fuhrman, or doctor Michael Greger?  I think it could heal your son!
What is that?  None of the doctors told me about that.  I will look into it.  Thank you! You've given me hope I never knew I had! \ You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office, but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!
There is a little cat I tried to help last night. \ What happened to it?
He ran when my dog charged at him though and I am scared of what has happened to him. A lot of cats get hit around here \ That sucks.
MY children are making me mad \ What are they doing?
I told them to go to bed hours ago. I can still hear them giggling \ Oh lol, Well it
They do that every night. I cant wait for school to start. \ Sorry! I meant that kids do that, enjoy it mom while they are little :)
We were having a big family gathering and dinner today, and one of my nephews, who's four, wasn't feeling well. But his parents kept trying to force him to eat something anyway, and were being short-sighted. Well, the poor fella ended up puking onto his plate and ending everyone's appetite. \ I feel sorr for the poor guy!
Yeah, me too! I tried to comfort him afterwards. There's only so much you can do. No one was brave enough to chastise the parents for trying to get him to eat more than he should. \ Yea, they're his parents. I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child.
My friend worked really hard this semester. I'm sure he'll do great. \ That's nice of you to say about someone else. It's nice when someone can recognize someone else's hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed. I'm sure he knows how proud of him you are.
I actually look up to him. Makes me want to work harder. \ That's a good way to look at it, to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself, or just working?
I didn't get a chance to make dinner for my date, so I got her McDonalds \ Oops.  That's doesn't have to be a bad thing.  No one can resist fries from McDonalds.  How did she react?
She seem kind of surprised, but she did eat everything. Not a fry survived. \ Well, there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you, then she sounds like a keeper!
My husband is coming home after a year abroad in the Army. I'm about to burst I'm so happy! \ You must really miss him! So glad you'll finally be reunited with him.
I did...immensely.  Its the hardest thing I've ever endured with him leaving, especially because I have to young kids.  We're going to have a huge party! \ Oh you have kids, too? They're going to be so happy!
I'm going water skiing next weekend. It's going to be such a breather from all this heat we've been getting lately. \ I've never done that before.
Neither have I. I'm looking forward to it. \ I bet its fun. I cant swim though
My daughter has be begging me to watch the movie IT \ IT? Haven't heard of it. What's it about?
I have know idea and I'm scared to watch it. \ Are you thinking about telling her you don't want to see it?
My momand I were discussing starting a non profit the other day. \ That's a great idea!  For what cause though?
Something that helps kids with clothing and other essentials for school.  \ That is very thoughtful of you.
Last week I found my gold fish floating at the top of the fish tank dead. \ Oh no. That has happened to us so many times. I thought fidh were easy
I am so hurt over it.  It was 5 years old. \ Wow. Im sorry
I am ok with being average. \ I don't think there is anything wrong with average. 
I agree. Average is good. \ We are all average until circumstances require us to be extraordinary. 
We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it.  \ Did anyone get hurt?
No, thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area.  \ Thats good, as long as no one got hurt.
Learned earlier today that I had been drinking all day out of a cup that had been used earlier by someone who has bronchitis. I'm hoping it's not too contagious... Why can't people properly clean and put things away so I don't confuse dirty dishes with clean dishes! \ People can be inconsiderate sometimes. I hope you don't get sick!
Well, we'll see. I'm generally pretty healthy and haven't been to the doctor in like over 6 years for anything other than the flu. So, hopefully my immune system will keep it at bay. But it was just it's something so simple and avoidable, and they didn't do it. I guess I should feel more empathy for them though, since they're sick. \ That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
ended up getting a pizza from Costco. I'm so hungry \ Oh man, Costco pizza is great, and so cheap, too. It may not be the best, but for the price and quantity, you can't really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often?
Not really. I kinda feel like I don't get much, but their food court stuff is great value for the money. \ Yeah, I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still, I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.
I let my friend borrow my car today \ That was so nice of you.  What did they need to use it for?  Were you able to live without it?
I was fine until she brought it back with no gas and left trash allover the seat. I couldnt believe it \ What?!! That's terrible.  I don't understand how people don't take care of things that don't belong to them when its a privilege to use borrowed things.  
I just bought a lawn mower because mine broke and the grass was getting so long. I barely had it 3 days when my shed was broken into and it was stolen! I'm so irate! \ That is terrible. Some people ar just no good.
I know. it really ruins any faith I have in people.  Plus, it was so much money that I had saved for quite a while and now I'm back to square one.  I could explode thinking about it. \ I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.
My father and brother are in a serious conflict with each other right now, as my father has complained about the way my brother raises his son. Obviously it's a really stressful, tenuous situation and I have no idea who's side to take, and I'm worried it will lead to them not wanting to keep in touch anymore. \ Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you don't need to take a side and try to work for peace.
Yeah, you're right. It's kind of complicated, but I definitely shouldn't try to pick sides. I just want everyone to get along, but it's not that simple. It's like I can't figure out if I try to make peace, whether that will make things more complicated or not, and whether I should just stay out of it. Time will tell. \ It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help.
I woke up one morning and found a puppy in my bed. I wasn't expecting that! \ Whoa! Was that a good surprise, or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way, but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well, actually it was in my parent's bed, and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents, and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with.
That sounds like a fun Christmas morning.  For me it was a fine surprise.  I think my wife got it for herself, but surprised me with it. \ That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.
I lent my car to my 17-year-old sister today. She left at 10 in the morning and it's midnight, and she still isn't back with it. I trust her mostly, but she hasn't been driving for long, and it makes me nervous thinking of her out there on the road \ Did you call her? I hope she's ok!
I tried, and she didn't pick up. I texted her a few times, and she's responded here and there, letting me know her whereabouts, and that's she's fine. But we had an agreed upon time that she's not following, so I don't feel like she's respecting my trust. We'll have to have a talk when she comes home. \ I'm glad you're going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.
Just moved and there is a pier near where I live \ Oh, that's kind of nice. It's nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live, so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace. I've lived near the ocean all my life, and while I do take it for granted from time to time, I try to remember how useful and beautiful it is.
Yea. I'm so used to living in the center of the city. Nothing but cars and buildings. I already feel so relaxed here. \ Sometimes it means increased work commute, or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!
I won a year of unlimited pizza. I'm so psyched. \ that is awesome! 
Yea, it is. If I'm ever tired of cooking, I can always get pizza. \ It will save you a lot of money too
I am so ready to light a candle and bingewatch \ Oh nice. What will you be binge watching?
Not sure yet.  I just finished Nashville and ready to move on to something else \ Hope you find something you like.
I saw firsthand today how caring my cousin can be with children. She was being patient and cooperative with my unruly and difficult two-year-old nephew, and she's only 13-years-old herself. I was pretty proud of how she handled the difficult situation, and it made me imagine her as a mother in the future. \ She will do great. OR she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful
Yeah, that's true. He's just a distant relative, so she doesn't see him often. But you're right, I shouldn't immediately assume she would have them. I just think she'd be good with them, is all. But kids these days seem to be a little more picky about whether or not they'll have children, so we'll see. \ Lids today are so picky about everything. Its sort of strange. Its nothing like when I was growing up
My friends are always flaking on me \ That's terrible. Sometimes it's hard to know who your real friends are, and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them, only to have them bail on you, to realize that you're not valued by them. I say cut your ties sooner rather than later. Life's too short.
I have to get a baysitter and spend moen just to prepare to go out. Its so inconsiderate. I think I need new friends. \ Oh man... When you consider all that, then yeah, definitely cut ties. If they did that to me more than twice, then I would realize really quick that they weren't the type to depend on or waste time on. I feel sorry for you. People should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship. Go out and find you someone who will.
There's a battle of the bands going on. I hope my favorite band gets so far \ Wow, that sounds exciting!
It's been really fun. So nice to see so many people rock it out. \ I love a good rock concert!
The other day I accidentally stepped in dog feces. \ Oh god. Someone did pick up their dog's poop, hu?
No, unfortunately not.  It really grossed me out. \ It must've been. I hope that never happens to you again.
I lost my wallet once but someone returned it to me. felt good. \ I bet it did.
yea i was super happy that they were a good person. \ Not too many of those around nowadays
I bought lots of snacks for the kids lunches this month \ oh that was good of you.
Well not really. Ive eaten about half of them. I feel terribel \ oh haha i know that feeling.
I know I shoudve have. Next time I will buy snacks I dont like \ thats a good idea.
I took off work to go to a concert, but it got cancelled. \ Thats a bummer
It is. Now it's going to be hard to take off work for the makeup concert. \ Whos concert?
My new laptop is being delivered Monday \ Nice. Are you excited?
I am so excited. I got exactly what I wanted, \ I hope it's what you expected to be!
I've been really sick, and my cat has been taking care of me \ That is so sweet of your cat.
Yea. He's usually not this affectionate. \ Well, I hope you get better soon.
Next week, I am going to Las Vegas! \ Oh sweet. Sin city! What do you look forward to doing?
I'm looking forward to the dining and drinking.  I can't wait! \ Oh yea. I heard the buffets there are amazing.
I really like the movie, A Bugs Life. \ I saw that movie a long time ago.
Yes. I laughed the whole time. \ What was your favorite part
I saw a video of little Russian girl punching a tree to shreds with her tiny hands...by the time she was done it looked like a shaved pencil, I thought it was awesome \ Cool, I guess she was strong.
Yeah she definitely was...if I have a daughter I'm gonna train her to be a lethal weapon \ Do you have any kids?
I am taking care of my sister when she get out of the hospital \ Good for you.You are an exampler brother.
She can't drive or walk around to much \ That is so hard to imagine.She will need all the help she can get from you.
I am so happy theses days. \ That is great to hear.  Anything in particular?
My vacations are coming and I am going to Italy with the family. \ Cthat sounds amazing!
I was walking back home today, and I had to go through the front yard. The summer time means lots of rain, and so the grass gets a little tall. While I was walking through it, I stepped on a snake! I screamed like a little baby and jogged away really fast \ Oh god that's terrifying haha. I hate snakes.
Yeah, me too. I find them interesting, but would never want them as a pet or anything. Seeing them once every few years in a zoo is fine with me. This one was a black snake, but that's all I really remember. Didn't get a good look. It slithered away fast. I think it was as scared of me as I was of it. \ I know what you mean, they are cool to look at but if they are near me it spooks me hard.
My senior year wasn't nearly as good since my brother left for college that same year. \ That's tough. I have two older brothers, so I know how that is. We're separated by four and eight years, respectively, so we weren't as close as you two seem to be, but I always liked having them around.
I feel you, me and my brother are really close so it was pretty sad not having him around. \ Well, absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained, but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more. Hopefully his college work doesn't stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out.
Its my birthday tomorrow and my husband put together a huge party for me. I'm so excited about it that I may not be able to sleep tonight! \ Your husband sounds awesome. That's interesting that you're the type of person that actually likes birthday parties. Most people I know would be too embarrassed or self-conscious to enjoy them, and they'd feel uncomfortable. Especially me. But for you, I'm glad you can get into them. 
He is wonderful and ever though he isn't used to planning and putting bigger events together, it sounds like he has it all ready.  I do love them!  I don't bother taking time to be ashamed of my age. I embrace it with life! I'm turning 40.  \ Oh, I didn't mean anything about the age! Who cares about that. I'm just a doofus when it comes to social interaction, so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me. But I hope you have a lot of fun, especially since your husband went through so much effort. I bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great.
I was playing with football with my two nephews, just throwing the ball around, and I threw the ball too high and hard for my younger nephew. It sailed past him and nailed the neighbor's car behind him, and left a dent in the door. I felt so stupid having to go up to their house and tell them what happened.. \ Oh no!  My gut feels sick for you having to go through that.  It happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.  How did the neighbors take it?
They were pretty respectful and understanding, and realized that those things just happen, especially when kids are involved. They appreciated that I came and told them right away. Mostly it was because the dent isn't that serious and they feel like they can get it out without much problem. But yeah, I'm glad I don't have a jerk for a neighbor who would have blown up \ Its so commendable that you went over and told them right away.  Not everyone would do that.  Your actions increases my faith in the goodness of people.
I haven't played my flute in years. Picked it up the other day, and I was still able to play my favorite songs. \ That is cool.  When did you learn?

The piano I ordered is coming in next week. \ Are you exited about it.Do you play the piano.

Me and some friends are going to Miami. \ That's awesome. How long are you guys going to be there?
Last week was my birthday and I had to work. \ That sucks. Did you get a raincheck on your birthday though?
I still went out after work and also, when I git to work, my office was all decorated and there was a cake and gifts on my desk! I was not expecting it! \ I'm glad they did that for you. So it wasn't all that bad having to work on your birthday then.
I walked to an apartment and it took me a while to realize I was in the wrong apartment. \ Uh oh. Was someone in there?
They were all asleep. That's pretty dangerous for them. \ Oh wow! That is kind of scary.
I am so thankful for having so much land \ That's good to have land you own.
I really like the privacy \ Privacy is so important to have sometimes.
The store I usually buy bird food from raised their prices at least 4 times. \ That isn't cool.  Is there anyone else that sells it?

I feel very happy right now. \ That's great.  What is the good news?
I just found out my family will come to visit me soon (I live quite far away), so that made my day. \ I am very happy for you!
I am looking forward to the next season of Game of Thrones! \ Oh me too! I heard it will be the last one.
I am so excited just thinking about it. I can't wait! \ Me too! I hope we both enjoy it a lot!
I am so glad I can talk to my parents about things \ Good for you. I always had communication problems with my parents 
That is common.  I feel very fortunate \ Yes, you should,You are very lucky.
I am so disappointed on Trump \ You and me both my friend
He just acting more erratic with the passing of time \ I know it is so disturbing

I use to be the number one tennis player in the state. \ That is an awesome achievement! Was it for high school or college?
It was in high school. \ I never played any sports in high school, I always had to work. That is a great accomplishment!
I love seeing old friends.  \ That is great, how long has it been since?

I have to admit they were way better than I expected and I would love to hear them again. Congrats on the baby! \ Thanks! What band did yall see?
I never thought I could love someone as much as my little baby girl. \ I know! It's almost an unexplainable feeling isn't it?
Yes, It is so hard to describe honestly! \ But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!
Thank you! It is hard at times tho when getting little sleep. \ Best advice I ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!
I am confident the democrats will bet Trump in november. \ That's interesting. What makes you confident? 
The recent results on the special elections, all democrats wins. \ Ah I see. That would be a good guess then.
I am feeling a little nervous at the moment. \ Is there a reason.Are you expecting bad news?
I actually just had a big job interview, and I am not sure how the results are gonna go. \ I am sure you are prepared for this interview.
I am in awe with what I saw last week. \ What did you see?
I saw a miracle.I work at the ER and a patient died for 2 minutes and came back to life. \ Wow! That is a miracle!
Next week I am going camping with my friends. \ Good luck in your camping.I hope you have a lot of fun.

It was nice to have an adult gathering with no kids with family \ Yes! sometimes I like such gatherings
Nice to get drunk with my parents \ Ha ha ha. yes indeed!
Today I saw a person screaming at a puppy. \ Why would they do that?
I have no clue but I was really upset about it. \ Man did you say anything?

Yeah it was so nice, it made me really happy. He's very sweet.  \ I am very happy for you!

A few years back, my husband was diagnosed with viral meningitis and then while in the hospital he got Bells Palsy. \ Yikes, door guy can't catch a break. Is he ok?

I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little. \ Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think.
Yea, until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either. \ Have you ever done anything else so frightening?

Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15? \ At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.

Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer

I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline  \ Unfortunately, I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. 
I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing \ How so?
In our friend's birthday party, i saw my partner chatting with her male college friend. They seemed very joyful and it made feel jealous \ Maybe it is your imagination.The were probably catching up.

They live so close to me and they are always helping me out. \ wow, thats so nice.  there are alot of people in life who have no one.
There are alot of people in need of care in this world. \ Yes there are. It is so sad.

Yea, I was given it as a kid so I was happy to find it after all these years! \ Be sure and put it in a safe place.
Last night i was with my friends hanging out, but lied to my partner about it and told that i will be at work staying late. I did not to hear more nagging from her \ Well that's not right no matter what your excuse because now you're not trustworthy see
I know. I think our relationship is headed in a wrong direction \ It's better to end things than to wait for years. Don't waste any more time like I did. 4 years
I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand! \ It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this

The project was worth more than a million dollars \ wow, And did you ever end up finishing the project?
No \ I see,  what did you do instead
Sometimes social situations make me so uncomfortable. \ Really?
yes I dont understand why but I just get this crazy feeling inside  \ Sometimes I do
That sucks but they do say distance makes the heart grow fonder.  \ I'm not sure what you mean, but disntance does tend to make things more difficult
My boyfriend is out of town for work and I really miss him. I can't wait until he gets back. \ That's hard, but he will be back! Try to take your mind off him by doing some fun activities
My friend never paid me back the money I loaned him! \ That's horrible!  This is why they say never a lender nor a borrower be..
Well, even worse is that he pretends like it never happened. It make things...difficult \ I hope it wasn't a lot of money.  Sometimes it takes a hard lesson to learn whom to let in your life.
I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town. \ Do you have plans to get together?

The anniversaries for my Daddy and my sisters passings are coming up this month. \ Sorry to hear.  Will you be planning anything special?
I want to do something but haven't decided what yet. It will be 18 years for him and this is her first which makes it especially hard. \ If you have other family member around you, ask around and get everyone involved.  It should be nice.
A buddy of mine once showed up and my door after years of not seeing him \ I bet that was a nice surprise.
It was, I was so excited to see him, I couldnt believe my eyes \ That is so cool. 
I just moved to a new state all by myself. \ Wow, how are you adjusting?

I can't find another way to earn money \ There are usually many ways, but it depends on what you want to do!
I just want to work from home \ Well, we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us

Yes. I grew up in the city. \ wasn't Johnny Manziel susposed to save that team?
As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this. \ That is good, how old are you?

I trust him for the most part but I don't trust her not to make him regret things later. \ That is good that you trust him, but temptation is never good for anyone.
My boyfriend and I broke up and he moved out. \ That's really tough.  But one closed door leads to the next great opportunity.
Before he left, he damaged a lot of my stuff and property. \ That's horrible!  If you don't have insurance there are a lot of pro bono lawyers that will take your case.  Report it to the police so it is documented and justice will prevail.  You don't deserve or need to put up with that.
My brother showed up with an xbox for me out of the blue. \ What a nice gift! My little brother did the same for me actually. Xbox one S last year

I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials \ Do you have a baby one the way?

That and so much more. She is a natural with dogs and her work ethic is amazing. \ wow she must be a really good dog owner, is this her first?
Once I went on a trip and realized I didnt forget a single thing. \ That had to make you feel good. It is so easy to forget when your trying so hard to remember. LOL
Story of my life,  I always forget things no matter how hard I try \ I always make a list before a trip and triple check it before I leave.
I just discovered that my girlfriend had been sleeping with my best friend \ That's terrible!  How did you find out?
My friend confessed which, I give kudos for, but he knows what he did. It doesn't make it ok \ It's hard to find forgiveness for something like that.  Still it's better that he confessed than you having to find out otherwise.  If only a little better/
Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing! \ What did you almost buy?
I saw this great used car in a print ad, and went to the dealership, but when I got there, it was all ratty and crappy looking! \ Ah, yea, I've had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down, find a decent one, or leave
I entered an art exhibition recently. I've been an artist for over 20 years, and just gathered the courage to share my work. I'm glad I did! \ Congratulation. How it went?
They were hosting a competition and I received amazing feedback. I actually won first prize and "the people's choice" award! I couldn't believe it! \ That is very nice. Congratulation.
Someone broke my window with a soccer ball. I made angry. I couldn't find who it was \ Oh no! I hate that happened and I bet it was scary because it looked like someone broke in. But now you have a repair bill. Sorry that happened to you.
Yes, it was scary. I was watching TV when happened. \ I hope the person's conscience makes them feel guilty and they come clean about the situation! And hopefully reimburse you!

Yes, as long as I am with someone. \ Has it ever caused you to not be able to enjoy certain things in life?
I had to have some extra tests ran a few weeks back due to an unclear mammogram. \ Were the results good or bad?
Finally they came in a few days later and all is clear thank goodness.  But that was a harrowing few days! \ Yes I am sure it was.
She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy. \ oof that is rough.
Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors  \ those foids deserve it.

For some reason heavy rain at night brings up some good memories for me. \ I love heavy rain, it just really soothes me.
Yes, the sound that it makes when the windows are open... \ I know! Also the thunder is so cool to listen to.
I got this gold chain from my dad and I still wear it every single day. \ What kind is it, Cuban?
I'm not sure, it was just a seemingly normal gold necklace with a charm on it. \ Cool, I like those, but they are crazy expensive, if you want a thick one.
Honestly there is nothing worse then having to go on a trip out of the country by myself. \ Why you don't invite a friend to come with you?
It was for business, but the meetings only last for a few hours everyday. So I am just kind of waiting in my room because I'm to worried about getting lost if I wander about. \ Why don't you take a guide or a book to help visit?
Two weeks ago, I found my home totally flooded. I felt totally destroyed. \ Oh no I am so sorry. Did you have flood insurance at least?
No. In area where I am, houses are not supposed to get flooded. That is terrible. \ Did you lose anything you can't replace? Important documents or pictures? Must be some bright light.
I had very supportive parents while attending college. I was very appreciative of their help. \ i bet, sounds like it would be nice.
It was, I knew if I was ever having stress or freaking out over exams, they could help reassure me. \ yea but exams can still really suckk
I saw a picture of an old movie i saw as a kid and i felt a bit sad when seeing it \ Movies can be emotional, do you remember the film?

I wasn't feeling right a few days ago, but I guess I'm alright now. \ I did a research on a cancer vaccine  
Well I meant my mood, not my health in general. \ Oh sorry for the mix up
It was a 5 million dollar research project \ What was it about?
Cancer research  \ Did succeed at anything?
I just unearthed hidden treasure, an entire box of old comics and stuff from my grandparents attic.  \ Wow that's so cool! Which comics were they?

I am very much looking forward to a trip with my family. \ Sweet, where abouts are you going?
We are going to see the caverns in Virginia. It should be beautiful. \ No doubt, do you have a tour guide or is it just free for you to roam about?
As I was people watching today I suddenly felt very happy. \ What happened to you?
That's a thing, nothing really, I guess I just relaxed for a bit. \ OK. I hope you are now fine?
5 \ What about 5?
5 \ I still have no idea what do you mean?
We had to rush my grandmother to the ER yesterday because she passed out and hit her head on the tile floor. \ Oh god, that's awful! Is she alright?
Luckily she's fine, but she has no memory of it. The Doctor suspects she might be losing her balance \ That would make sense, assuming she is getting pretty old.
I got quite upset when I was talking to the last girl I went on a date with. \ Oh no, did she say something really upsetting?
The exact opposite. She ghosted me right after despite saying the date was good. \ Oh that's the worst...I wish people would just say what they want to say
I am so ready for my final on Friday, Math ain't going to get this guy down \ oh do you have summer classes?
Yeah, figured I could try and get statistics done over the summer. Not my best idea \ eh its not bad, its quite productive 
I sat at home watching netflix all last night for a few hours \ Man that sounds like the dream. Watching anything good?

During a work meeting, I was presenting and then suddenly my pant dropped. I felt so bad. \ Oh my gosh. Why did your pants fall?
The pant button broke. After it felt. I was holding it up with my hands. \ Were you able to laugh it off or were you so mortified you wanted to crawl out of the room?
My new neighbors put their dogs out at the same time I had mine out. Of course mine went nuts running to bark at the new guys on the block \ I understand. Were you able to manage the situation?
Pretty much but it involved yelling. \ It is ok. It was a scary situation.
I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.  \ Wao, you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?
I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him. \ SUper tough situation, i think you should let her know, and let her decides next
I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it? \ Oh, I'm sure you were embarrassed! But, maybe you can laugh about it now?
Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching \ Well, I'm sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!
I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding \ Yes, you only hurt yourself when you get angry.
I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again \ Give it some time, maybe she'll change her mind.
Have you ever wish to switch places with your cat for a day or two? \ Never. I hate cats personally
How about, dogs? \ I've come to hate them too unfortunately. Constant noise
After the earthquake  I visited the old capitol, and saw still intact temples.  \ Oh, that's so sad. What earthquake?
It was a 8.6 I believe, but it happened like 2 years ago. \ Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage
I have a big presentation tomorrow, and I'm not sure if I'm prepared enough \ What kind of problems?
Well, I haven't practiced enough and I need to refine my notes I think \ Do you have enough time for it?
I was so glad that my friend told me something right as I was walking into school. \ Why, what did he tell you?
