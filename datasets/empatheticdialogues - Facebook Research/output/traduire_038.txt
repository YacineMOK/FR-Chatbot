There was a girl at the park today doing flips and a cartwheel. It was so crazy! \ Wow. That is impressive! I can't even do a cartwheel on a mat.

My friend got into a really bad car accident. I'm so glad she's ok \ That is scary. I hope she wasn't too shaken up from it.

I am so nervous about the certification test I have to take for my job. I am worried I won't pass it. \ It must be nerve wrecking especially since it has so much impack on your job.

My coworker went into labor, and we somehow all brought a baby into the world \ That's awesome! And crazy... And scary... and awesome all at once! You must kinda feel accomplished though, huh? Good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy. Kind of weird how you all will have that special, unique bond for the rest of your lives, now. 
Yea. It was overwhelming but in a good way. And yea, guess we will all carry this special bond for the rest of their lives now. \ It's funny, you guys walked into work that day and thought it'd be another usual, boring day. You clocked out maybe with some blood on your shirt, smelling like newborn. Awesome.
I booked an AirBnB for our vacation this week. We just got here, and they forgot to mention a little detail about having a cat. My spouse and I are both very allergic to cats... We can't stay here now! And yet we're getting charged for cancelling, and we have to find a new hotel. \ Wow. I definitely would take it up wiht your credit card.
Yeah, something like that. Really not looking forward to dealing with that while I'm vacation, but I have to get it done sooner rather than later. They didn't even seem that remorseful about it, either. Like it was more our problem. How are cat allergies a surprise thing to people who are trying to be in the hospitality industry? Dumb \ They really should be more considerate. allergies are a serious medical concern.
I was chatting with this girl who I thought liked me, but she thought she was texting my friend. \ What happened? Did you ask her to go out on a date?

My dog pooped all over my head yesterday. Smelled kinda gross and I was quite disgusted. \ Wow. Why did he do that?
I have no idea. Maybe he was irked about the food I put out for him the other day. \ If he wasn't happy with the food, there arebetter ways to tell you.
My emu ran away last night. I was quite distraught. \ Not sure what an emu is. I hope you find him/her!
Me too! She was such a darling bird. I'm not sure why she would run away so swiftly. \ Maybe she just wanted to go play. I hope she comes back.
My spilled soda on my laptop. After a day of not using my laptop, thank god it turned back on. \ That really sucks. That would have been an instance to cry over SPILLED milk indeed!
I was really stressed out, because I had information with a lot of money on it. \ Never thought about that. Thank god you recovered it!
So last night I snuck into the kitchen at my cousins house. \ I hope they are good cooks.

My girlfriend moved some of our mutual money without letting me know \ Sorry to hear that my friend.. Was she facing an emergency?

I feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me, he passed away last year \ So sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did it happen?

WIsh that did happen to you, better luck next time. \ I always have the worst luck.

Sunglasses. They were back ordered and didn't arrive in time for my trip to the beach. \ Oh no! Hopefully you will get to wear them on your next trip to the beach.

I am awaiting the decision for the new credit card with Chase that I have applied couple of days ago. I really need it \ I have a Chase credit card. They really aren't that great, but I do hope you get approved. Why do you need it?

My dog crapped on the rug.  \ Oh no!  I bet it smelled bad.  Did you clean it up?
Oh, believe me it did. It's still sitting there from a few weeks ago because I don't have the courage to pick it up. I'm waiting for her to clean her mess up herself. \ LOL it's been on the carpet for a few weeks???  Clean it up already.  She won't do it

I once kept a notebook in which I wrote down how my friends would die. \ Wow. You were either very imaginative or upset.

I lied to my friend today \ That's kinda bad. What did you lie about?
I know its bad, but I went out eith some new friends who probably wouldn't get her like I do \ Well, I suppose it is justified as long as you don't do it all the time.
My co-worker returned 20 bucks to me the other day after I lost it. \ Thats good. Where did they find it?
He found it a couple of feet from my cubicle. I am so glad since I need it to buy doritos and mountain dew. \ Is that how much doritos and a mountain dew costs there. geez
There is a co-worker who frequently asks me to help him with his tasks. He is very incompetent and i can't understand how he was hired \ thats the same thing happening at my job , super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying

i used to collect spawn comics , one time i got home and saw all my comics torn up , it was so mad  \ That is horrible. Did you find out who did it?

Well, this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever, but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago, I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me, and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks, in the middle of the road, jumped out, and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short, I saw my own reflection in the mirror.  \ THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.
It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it, lol \ That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?
I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted, I am 32 now, lol \ Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms.
I am watching old episodes of game of thrones right now \ i have heard good things about that show.  are you a fan?
I am the biggest fan. I can't wait til the last season. This ummer was so boring \ is it going to be the last season? that's too bad.

A group of pigeons was stalking me the other day. \ Oh geez, that is certainly cause for alarm. Did you summon the stoop kid?
We don't have one, I was so terrified. \ Ah, there is your problem right there. 99.9% of the time a stoop kid will chase away nasty pigeons, no problem.
Once I studied a lot for the SAT because I needed to make sure I got at least a 2000. \ I never took the ACT
I studied so much to take it and do well to ensure that I would get a scholarship. By the time I took it, it felt very familiar. \ I meant SAT. I took the ACT. how did you do in the end?
In the end I got a 2100 and got that scholarship. But I dropped out of that university anyway! \ Is that not funny? I think its hilarious
Me and my cousin just reconnected \ Interesting. What lead to that?
Well she moved away to college and didnt come back after graduating.  \ Were you guys close when you were younger?
Yes. very. we are the closest in age. We see each other when she comes to town but we had a 6 hour conversation on the phone today and it was like the old days \ Man it's so much fun to just have a good conversation with people. 
I am so upset with my children \ That's no good. Why are you upset with them?
They were supposed to clean while I was gone today and I came home to a big mess \ I would be equally as angry. I think I would've put them up for adoption.
I took out the trash today and the bag burst all over me. I knew I shouldn't have kept 50 pounds of ramen sitting in the fridge for 2 months. \ Why put ramen in the fridge?
I am a poor college student and needed to eat the leftovers. Thought it would stay good for all eternity. Guess it doesn't when it's cooked. \ How are you  doing in college? because that is ridiculous lol
Two more days and it is on! \ Awwww yeah! ...what exactly is on?
Kid is in school. Pre-K. I wish I could have a day party lol \ Yeah! Come on over here and we'll throw a regular ole pizza party!
I ate 50 pounds of ramen the other day. Never felt so bad for all the college kids that gazed on in envy and horror. \ Can they not afford ramen?
Nope! Well, I suppose they can, but not as much as I. I am the Ramen King and impose a stiff ramen tax for every ramen meal consumed by all poor college students. \ I'd vote you class president!
i am not going to be able to see my favorite band when they come to town \ What's the band?
def leppard.  they are going to be with reo speedwagon and tesla too. \ Wow. That must suck. Do you like the band incubus? I missed them a couple of times but I saw them this year
i do, they did a song called wish you were here that i loved. \ yes. I wish I could send you a clip of it from the concert. It was awesome. Maybe you could catch def leppard next time. 
I love cron dogs \ corn dogs are yummy. where do you get yours from?
I didnt buy the one I had today. IT was pork and I could tell. It was terrible \ ew. that sounds bad. but if it was free, i guess that's a good thing.

Some knocked the door forcefully. I was alone at that time. \ Oh no. Who was at the door? Was it a mime?
My kids wouldn't clean their room yesterday. I was quite displeased. \ Oh no, I hope you pardon them. 
I shan't! I will put them up for adoption on the morrow! \ This is too much of punishment for kids.
I once saw the music sheet of the best clarinet player in my high-school band. \ Oh that really cool.. I bet it was really complicated, huh?
Exactly. There were marks all over it and it showed how much she practiced. \ It is always awesome to see a genius at work. a glimpse into their passion
I was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss \ I don't have a normal job anymore but that would frustrate me as well.
Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy \ What a disgusting person. I'm just being honest.
I went to a comic book convention last month \ That sounds really cool.
Yeah. i felt like i was a child again, standing amidst all those superheroes \ Oh, such great nostalgia.

Yes it is wonderful. It is like complete peace and harmony. There is nothing better! \ You definitely deserve it.
When my Grandmother passed away, it was really hard for me. \ Oh my goodness I bet! I am sorry to hear that you went through that.
I was really worried about my Grandfather, but I think he has finally accepted her death and moved on. \ Well that is definitely good to hear. It must be so hard to go that long as somebody's "side kick" and lose them.
I am really looking forward to this season of the Lakers, with Lebron coming in \ Oh wow, i did not even know about the transfer. I bet Laker fans are delighted
They are on cloud 9! With such a legend on their team, who wouldn't be, right? \ So true. I might become a lakers fan myself at this point
I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC \ Oh the broadway musical? I heard really good reviews of it
It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this \ Oh yeah, he is such a true genius of our times, he deserves it

I was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day \ Oh.. Were you sick?
Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it \ Don't feel bad about it buddy, this happens to all of us sometime. Feel better
I can't believe that I stole food from the soup kitchen. \ Aw man, I've been there before. Don't regret it one bit. More food for us, right?
Yes but I should not of stolen the food, that was wrong of me. \ Nah, you're good man. You probably did it for good reason.
My mother passed away today. \ That is terrible news. I am so sorry.

This was several years back. I was single, but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie, so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake.

At the time, I was like I want that; however, now that I am in a relationship, I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well \ Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..
So we had a meeting at work this week. Turns out we may have to shut down in the next few months. \ Omg... thats terrible! Im so sorry - Ive been through similar. Are they going to give you some sort of money upon lay off? 
I feel like if they go through with it they have to offer us packages right? \ If they have a heart or soul they will! They really should...

Yeah I lied to the professor and he let me do it later that day. \ cool,, thats great
I knew i would pass my test after all my studying \ That's good to hear. What subject was this in?

A flood hit and destroyed my house oh god no. \ Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Was anyone hurt?

It is so crazy to me. My best friend and her husband have an open marriage and I just cannot fathom having another partner other than my husband. \ I always wondered how you start something like that up with your partner without hurting their feelings.
I know it. They both apparently just don't mind it. Makes me wonder if they are really in love or just kind of creatures of comfort. \ Whatever makes you happy I guess. To each their own.
One of my friends just got a girlfriend and it was really surprising that he would get one before the rest of us. \ Why were you surprised? Is he shy?
He's pretty shy and also because he is just not great with women overall.  \ Some girls like a certain type. Or maybe it was written in the stars.
I sat in something wet and didn't know it. Walked around all day with a wet rear. \ That's pretty embarrassing haha. Ever find out what it was?

I got into an argument with my mom since we really need money and she wants me to get a job. \ Aww.  How do you feel about that?
I was already looking for jobs at the time so the argument really annoyed me. \ Yeah I bet.  Hey at least you're out there trying.  That's all you can really do.
I almost got into a wreck today because someone cute me off on my way to work. \ How terrible! I bet your heart stopped in that moment.
Yea it did. I was so frustrated that someone could be so careless. \ People seem to only care about themselves a lot.
One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce. \ I am so sorry. I can't imagine what you must have went through.
I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from. \ That must have been really hard. 
I get feel so irate when I lose any form of game. \ Me too! I like to win, I guess that makes me competitive.
Don't know if its a good trait to have but its one I can't shake. \ It is a good thing, it gives you an edge.
i miss watching chiller theatre with my family on fridays \ Wow, what is chiller theatre? I'm intrigued.

I just felt like I barely did bad enough to not get a B in the class and that's what happened. \ Don't worry, I'm sure you did fine.
Some days I feel so alone as if I'm the only person on this earth \ I know what you mean, that has happened to me before and it is an awful feeling.
I don't know if its depression or something else. \ It probably isn't, I really hope it isn't too.
No one showed up for my birthday \ Sorry to hear that. What did your friends say?
Nobody even remembered. I was sitting there all by myself.  I still had fun though, I guess. \ Hopefully your friends make it up to you!

I think about about young love and how innocent and youthful I was then. Life always seemed to have more potential and hope. \ oh dang thats a real thinker
I always have this feeling that someone or something is always behind me \ I know that feeling. I get it when I feel anxious.
It terrifies me and am not sure if there is actually some spirit or entity there. \ Have you tried yoga and meditation? It can help.
I let my teenage son borrow my car and he crashed it! \ Oh no, so sorry. Was your son okay?

south padre island in texas \ Cool!  I've never been there.  Are you excited to go?
Hi, I booked a 5 star hotel for my vacation and there were roaches in the hotel room :( \ That sounds terrible. I would expect nothing less for a presumably high cost hotel. 
I agree, I complained to the management and they gave me a new upgraded room. \ That's good but should also be standard for any hotel, nevertheless a 5 star one. How was the new room?
I wanted a new bike for my 10th birthday, yet all I got was a pair of socks \ You must have been rather disappointed. But its the thought that counts.
Yeah, I guess being a ten year old I couldn't understand the financial hardships that my parents were going through at the time. \ True, they only want the best for us. Sometimes that can mean making hard decisions, such as foregoing the bike.
Homeless people are very unfortunate. It breaks my heart seeing them living in desperation \ I feel you.I also get sad when i see people living of the street.
I hope I could help somehow, but I am short on my financial situation too \ There not a lot we can do.Maybe presure the local politicians 
I am very apprehensive nowadays, \ Why? Is it something with your work-life balance?
Yes.I just got interviewed for the job of my dreams and now i am waiting for an answer. \ You should take it easy. Just relax and cross your fingers for the best to come yet
my girl has been promoted i'm very excited \ Oh cool! What job does she work?
She is a reported with a major newspaper in New York \ That's really nice! Glad to hear that she is moving up the ladder!
I was getting really weird, aggressive texts from someone and it was starting to really scare me. \ if it's someone you know you should ask them not to do it again
It was a prank from my friend and they really got me good. \ oh thats bad!
I have faith that one day things will all work out \ I bet they will.  That's the way to look at things.  With some optimism!
I'm having a rough time at the moment so thats the only way I can move forward is to have faith. \ Yeah.  Well I wish you luck my friend.  Keep your head up!
I am so proud of my mother \ Ohh thats nice. May I ask what for?
She raised us 3 kids by herself.  Shes old now but she makes good money and bought her own house. \ What an amazing women. She must be very strong.
I cheated on a test last semester and feel bad about it \ I'm not one to judge. We all have done things we regret in the past. Why did you do it though?

I have hope for the human race even though its in its nature to destroy itself \ yea i know what you mean
Seeing the world today disheartens me but I feel hope. At least I must have hope. \ yea it sucks to think it might fail

I was feeling nostalgic when I went to my brother's recent birthday party. \ Oh that's always nice. What made you feel that?

Especially since he didn't pay a dime for any of them. \ yea exactly
I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive. \ Really?  What kind of work does he do?
He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country. \ Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.
Last week I had to put my dog to sleep.  It was really sad because I had him for 16 years. \ Oh no. I am so sorry. That is so hard. My daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him. :( What was your dog's name?
Ugh that happened to me before as well with another dog.  Her name was Doodles. \ Doodles. That's a cute name! I'm sorry about your dog. 16 Years sounds like a good long life.
I really wanted to get an A in this computer science class but hey I got a B so that's fine. \ Thats awesome. B is great and you'll smash it next time.
I hope so, I just really need to learn how to get better at it since it is my major. \ I guess to keep on trying and don't be so hard on yourself, a B grade is good enough too.
I get embarrassed very easily \ Give me an example of something that happened then.
Theres loads. Its just being around people. You see, I'm a very shy person and have always been. For example when somebody laughs, that triggers it. \ I know what you mean, I'm really really shy too.
I was really upset when my daughter went into labor and I couldn't be there.  \ I'm so sorry but what a joyous occasion. 
She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous. \ So happy for you. Is this your first grandchild?
I feel guilty as a parent because I don't like to part in a lot of my children's school activities \ Sometimes it just gets a little overwhelming. There can just be too much going on at once, especially if you have more than one child.
Exactly as I'm always busy but feel like a bad parent as most of the other kids have there parents there. \ You just have to do what is best for you and your family. One day your kids will understand, especially when they have kids of their own and have so many other things going on.

I was really young and didn't know any better so I stole this item that I really wanted and felt bad afterward. \ You need to wipe away the guilt and seek forgiveness for yourself.

Yesterday I just prayed and thanked the Lord before eating my dinner. \ That's great, I don't pray often because I'm not too religious...

He decided to quit College and join a band. \ If it doesn't work out he can always go back.
Back in senior year my brother moved out and my mom started to work a lot more. \ Did you start to feel a bit lonely?
Without a doubt. I was the only one in the house half the time. \ That's tough, but it helps you learn what you like to do on your own.
I am so shocked and hurt to hear my friend's puppy was stolen. \ Stolen? That's horrible!

I am overcome by joy when I'm with my son's \ That's precious. How old are they?
They are 8, 10, 12. They are the whole meaning of my existence. \ They are really starting to grow up, you better cherish them while you can.
My last relationship seemed to going so well until she basically flat out ghosted me. \ Sorry dude, thats rough. Do you know why she did that?
Not at all, I guess she just found another dude on Tinder or something. \ Women. Keep strong dude, theres someone out there for you.
I feel so bad that I took home a large amount of change from the cashier at the store! \ oh yea i know what you mean
Yeah I realized it too late to return it because I found out afterwards at home. \ it really does feel bad tho
I have to go back to school and leave all my friends in 2 weeks time \ It's important to spend time with your friends while you can!
yea i know but its kind of depressing i wont be able to see them after \ Make some good memories and enjoy these next few weeks.
Hi, so I let my cousin babysit my infant yesterday. \ Great, I bet he did a good job 
He did, I felt so trusting of him. I think I will call on him next time I need a babysitter! \ I know, it's probably because you are related 
I get disgusted anytime I see people treat animals badly \ I agree, people who do animal cruelty should be in jail.
I have just joined an advocacy group that is enlightening people about how they should treat animals so I am hoping thing will change  \ Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools.
I tried a lot harder back in high school and it really made me happy when it paid off. \ wow, really, what was the result?
I ended up with nearly all A's and a 3.8 GPA. \ really, that is excellent, you are a genius
One day i was in a haste to meet up with an appointment, i hit someone into the gutter, i made him miss his interview and i felt really guilty to meet up with my appointment \ Oh no that's too bad, it wasn't your fault at least.
yes, i know, but i would have been more careful to look well \ Yeah, just make sure that you aren't in too much of a rush like that.
Next week, I am getting my new car. I can't wait to have it. \ Really? Congrats 
I bought a honda civic 2018. \ That's a cool ride
I got my wife a wrist watch for her birthday  \ That is nice. Did she like it?
Yeah. \ That is great.
My girlfriend (ex) really made me upset when she broke up with me saying that she wasn't ready and then she found a new boyfriend almost immediately. \ Don't upset for her. May be she isn't worth for your love.
