A variety of vegetables and herbs. I can't wait for the finished product. \ That sounds delicious and healthy also.
I often think back about my younger years. \ It's nice to be able to look back. It can really give you perspective on your life now.

I was so scared of going onto the train! \ Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?

My daughters helped out when my Mom was sick without me having to ask. It made me feel really good \ Good for them for taking the initiative and helping the family.
That's the part that I was so impressed with.  \ You must of done something right in raising them.

Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon. \ That's a big step. I hope it works out for you.

There is something wrong with my sister in law.  She refuses to take her kids to the doctor for checkups or even when they are sick. \ Wow that's pretty bad parenting.
That's what my husband and I think.  I mean even when they were babies and would run 103 fever, she wouldn't take them.  I just do not understand that at all - they are both grown now but she's pretty uninvolved with either of them. \ Is it for religious reasons
I wish I didn't cheat on my now ex-gf \ Hindsight and all that - do you miss her?
Yes a lot.  I've accepted it but it's hard letting go \ Perhaps she may forgive you?  It's always worth a try, sometimes you just need some time and some growth before you can revisit mistakes that have happened.
So the other day I had a crazy long day and got home to find all of my chocolate was gone!  \ Oh my gosh! I would have been so upset! Nothing is better than chocolates on a bad day.

So I love that she has worked so hard to overcome this. \ My daughter is 1.5 years old - shes just been introduced to the water.. its always so special when our babies have their "first" moments. Congrats mama! 
I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS. \ Oh no, that sounds horrible
Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down. \ I am sorry, that is a sad thing to go through
Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry. \ Oh gosh, I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? 
Yes, I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something.  \ Wow! In that instance, I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. 
I had studied for an exam for several days, so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it \ and did you knock it out of the park? 
Uh, I made a B on it,  so it was a false sense of confidence, lol \ Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. 
I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid. \ Why would you not get paid?
I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes. \ I can imagine it is
I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents. \ Oh my, did it make you emotional?
Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young. \ Aw hopefully you never lose that picture!
When my son was 5 years old, he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing, but when they went to take him back, I got so anxious.  \ Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.
Yeah, he was fine, but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't, but I did.  \ That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.
I have fun plans this weekend over a friends house. \ What are your plans?
My friend is having a drink and paint party. I've only been to one before but it was pretty fun. I can't wait. \ Wow, that sounds like a fun and interesting time, but it sounds like there are a high chance for things to go south and be a huge mess
Just injured my ankle. Now I can't work \ Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. How deid it happen?

I am trying my best to go on a diet. It's not going well. \ How much would you like to lose?

I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it. \ Oh what was the surprise?! 
Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with. \ You should go on a little date if you can. or to the movies!
Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared. \ You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.
I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice. \ No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.
When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything. \ did you pay him back?
No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now. \ thats good thetn
I was one percent off from passing my math test, I was devastated. \ Oh my, so close! But you can try better next time.
I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect! \ Yes and theres no point mulling over it! 
 i was pissed when the gate was left open and our dog got out \ Oh no. Did it run off or stay close by?
he ended up a few streets away \ Hopefully he didn't get hurt. It might be time to put a lock on the gate.
When I was a child I nearly drowned in a swimming pool. I was so scared. \ who saved you?
My sister thought I was playing around but when she realized I was really in trouble she grabbed me. \ well that was observant of her.. sometimes people dont even notice 
I'm finding it super hard to move on from my last relationship. \ I know how that can be such a struggle.  How long has it been and why did it end?
Thanks.  I messed it up by cheating on her.  It's been 5 months \ Everyone makes mistakes, we live and learn I guess.  If there is no hope of her taking you back, then you have to find a way to move forward, but take the time you need to grieve as it is a loss.
My husband just finished taking all 4 parts of the CPA exam.  It took him almost a year to complete as he'd study for one part, take that part, then start studying for the next part. \ Nice! Does he feel pretty confident about it
Well, he said that he didn't.  But we found out a few weeks ago that he's passed all four parts so now he's a CPA! \ Awesome! Glad it worked out for him

One time I was outside a bar and got my butt kicked by 3 guys in a streetfight.  I held my own pretty well until they got me with a couple of beer bottles to the face.  I never went down.

When I go to the mall to buy clothes, I always feel so envious of others who are buying expensive items. I wish I could afford those things! \ I understand how you feel. I wonder how those people afford it.

A few weeks ago I got in my first real car accident. \ I am sorry to hear that.  You weren't hurt were you?

I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready! \ Ah, that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?

That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-)) \ Yes, I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!
I had to leave the house for a bit, before I left I gave my kids instructions on what I wanted them to do around the house. \ Did they follow your instructions, or did they do their own thing?
I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed. \ Wow!  I didn't expect that answer from you!  That must have been a great surprise!
My wife and I have been quite scared lately. There has been a rash of burglaries and robberies in our neighborhood lately and some have involved violence against the home owners! \ Good reason to be scared.  What steps are you both taking to increase security?
We have an alarm system with cameras and I also have a gun for self defense.  I have to protect my wife and daughter! \ A good sound plan.  You're right it is a father's responsibility to protect his family.

My Mother came into town unannounced.  She hardly ever does that. \ Is she staying with you ? 
No.  Thankfully it was just a visit.  She took us all to dinner, it was nice. \ Sounds like everything went better than expected.
I'm drinking a great cup of coffee and I don't have any major plans for the day other than relaxing. \ That sounds like a nice plan.  Do you often get the chance to take days off?
I'm normally off on the weekends. So its not a big deal. \ I've been thinking of forcing myself to take time off.  We all need a break from time to time.
I went to see the new conjuring movie in the theater.. it was such a terrifying experience \ Oh wow. is it really as scary as the reviews say it is?
that and much more! Especially if you choose to go and watch it alone at night \ Damn, sounds like such a stunning experience
i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out \ Oh dear me.. So sorry to hear that! what did you do?
I have not confronted them. I am still thinking over it. \ I really hope things work out for you my friend
Great UFC fights last night.  An even better night because I was hanging out with friends \ Friends and UFC sounds like a great night!  I missed the fight.  Were there any good knock outs?
Oh yeah!  TJ Dillishaw knocked out Corey in first round again!! \ Awesome!  Was that who you were hoping would win?
I am really praying that I get a promotion at work! I need the extra money and my boss knows I want it badly! \ I hope you get it too!  Best of luck!  We all could use extra money in the pocket!
Yeah, it is really important to me.  I am crossing my fingers! \ When will you find out?
A big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night. \ Disgusting. Was it the flying variety?
Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in. \ Gross.  We have those here too.  Typically you only see them during the summer.
I have a date tonight. \ Sounds promising.  Are you coming out of long dry spell?
Not super long... ~3 months. \ That's pretty short.  I went 7 years.  Decided the next girl I met I'd marry, we just celebrated 13 years toghether.
I have been feeling so pleasant and happy lately. Things in my life have just been going perfectly.  \ Holy cow that's awesome for you!  How are you feeling today?

I have a vacation coming up :) \ Awesome!  You must be excited!  Where are you going?

I was so grossed out when a friend threw up on me \ I can image, that's pretty disgusting.  What your friend sick or drunk?

I made sure everything was set and proper before i went abroad \ i feel like is should be prepared
Once I got a big gift in my mail. It was from an anonymous person. I never found out who gave it to me. \ That is fun! What was it?
It was a stuffed teddy bear. it was cute. \ What a neat mystery. I bet you wish you could thank them though. 
My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it.  \ Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?
We don't know them well, but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after, but some people have to get up for work.  \ I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.
My dog just threw up. \ Oh no. Did it eat something bad?
Nothing really it was just stomach acid.  She hasn't eaten since last night. \ I'm sure she is okay. My dog throws up randomly too sometimes.
The school year starts again soon, which means I have to start working again. \ That sucks.  How long have you been a teacher for?

I gave my credit card for a stranger to use once \ Why would you do that?
I felt sorry for the person, she looked trustworthy. and she needed to pay for some medicines for a friend who had accident \ So, why didn't you just pay for them your self?
I went on a job interview friday, and I think it went well. \ oh cool.. Is it in the field you like?
Same thing i'm doing now (IT) \ Good for you :) I wish and pray you get it buddy

I'm sorry? Are you still talking about the cops? \ Sorry, something wrong with the chat interface

Hello \ Hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them. Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.
Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in  \ Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.
Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places \ Yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience

My daughter was thrown from her horse a few months back. \ Oh no! Is she okay?

Back in the 2014 World Cup I was super excited when Argentina won against the Netherlands in the semi-final. It was crazy! \ So I take it you are a soccer fan?  It seems America is finally getting into the sport.  Do you play yourself?

I am going to North Korea.. I can't wait! \ Wow, that should be interesting, have fun!
I was disgusted when I saw a really big spider, I hate those things \ did you kill it ?
I did, I do not want them alive near me \ thats good
i was upset the other day when i couldnt leave home on time \ Why, what happened?
the wife taking her time.. \ That makes sense, you gotta prepare for that my man, you know how that goes!
I cannot wait for the new super smash bros for the nintendo switch \ I love the switch, I have been thinking about buying my own.
You should, it is amazing, I play so often, the novelty of having console games anywhere does not wear off, trust me! \ Would you say you play it more at home or on the go?
I found a stray puppy and nursed it back to health \ That is amazing, what breed was it?
It was a little baby blue healer,  became my best friend \ That is so great, did you keep it?
I am trusting of my girlfriend, we have been dating almost 3 years now \ that's good that you trust her! It's hard to have a relationship if you don't have trust
Exactly, with my younger generation, it is tough to find loyalty sometimes \ i agree! I've been married for 5 years and i can't imagine being with anyone else but my wife
I gained some weight when my wife was pregnant and now i finally lost 15 lbs. i feel great! \ That is good, it can be easy to sink into a bad lifestyle with a kid or stressed wife
She wasn't really stressed , she had nausea and the only food she could eat is french fries and pizza so i was eating all that food as well \ That makes sense too, that is all I eat now, my metabolism may catch me one day, I need to make changes as well, but great for you losing the weight!
Last vacation I collected rocks to take home and remember the trip by \ I do that too.. I take small tiny ones usually.  I have pieces of the grandcanyon and everything
Do you like to buy mementos and things at gift shops? \ Sometimes but I like natural cool stuff better, and making collages out of brochures and free stuff I find along the way.
I am really scared.  I moved into this new house and I swear to you it is haunted. \ WHAT?! do you hear noises at night?
Not only do you hear things, like footsteps and knocks, I can smell things.. \ Oh, my, god, I have lived in a haunted house before,  what do you smell?
I let my friend hold on to my wedding ring while I planned my proposal. \ what happened ? lost it?
No but I was worried if he was going to be responsible with it.  He did not loose it thank god \ thats good
i was upset the other day when i couldnt get home on time to get my kid to practice \ What happened? did you run into traffic?
yea traffic \ That is no fun,  was his coach upset he was late, or did you even make it at all?
I am so mad!  I went outside and an armadillo was eating my plants. \ NO! they can be vermin,  what did you do to get rid of him?
I yelled at it and told it to leave.  I live near a lake and all.. there is no getting rid of animals.   \ Did he jump up and run away?
Once my card got declined and the employee put 5 dollars on my gas pump anyway \ That was nice of him..  Did you pay him back ever
Yes I went back after my payday and gave him ten dollars \ THats really nice of you!  Was he surprised?
Once I woke up to what i thought was a ghost in my room \ WHAT? I would be terrified!! 
YES i was scared out of my mind, to this day I tell myself it was a dream. \ So you actually saw it?? how did it look? did it say anything?
I don't really trust people but i sure do trust my wife! She is so amazing, i know she would never lie to me, she simply can't lie \ Has she tried to lie before but just been a terrible liar?
she is just a terrible liar, she knows that and so she doesn't even try lol \ I am the same way, Every time I lie im thinking.  they dont believe me at all
I went to the first day of class knowing it was going to be easy. \ that's good. did it actually turn out easy?
Yes I passed with flying colors.  But that feeling made it that much easier. \ that's wonderful! Congrats! I didn't have a lot of easy classes when i was in college
I think i have anxiety attacks! I didn't even know that anxiety causes some physical pain. like the other day i felt like somebody was chocking me \ I have anxiety attacks too,  you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed.
yes! And i felt like that for 3 days on and off! \ that is crazy,  Its only usually a few minutes for me before I can talk myself down.
My wife was sick all last week, so I had to stick by her side. \ what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife
She caught a very bad cold. I brought her soup everyday and tended to her every need. \ When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one 
I want to evertually move to new york and be closer to my brother and friend , im just a bit afraid as i really dont know much about anything there \ Moving to a new place can make you uneasy, but once you make a couple of friends you'll get over it. 
Thank you, that actually made me feel better im planning on moving there early spring \ New York is very beautiful and the people there are very friendly, so i'm sure you'll do fine. 
I felt very joyful when I got into a college that I really wanted to go to, plus my friends were there already. \ Ah, congratulations! What a GREAT feeling. Are y'all all still good friends?
Most of them yes, things in life happen so I am not still in touch with all of them, but oh well. \ You know what, nothing to mourn, really. Life has chapters, you know? It's wonderful you have the memories you do.
I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered "better". \ I agree, its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas
It's just too many leaders want "yes men" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure! \ Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business
i was shocked when i couldnt go to the game i bought tickets for \ Oh, wow!  What happened?  
i had to stay at work  \ That stinks.  What did you do with your tickets?
I think I need to make a doctor's appointment, but I don't want to do it. \ why not? if it will possibly get you better
That's true.  I've just had these headaches, and they're kind of scary. \ might as well find out now before it get worse
We planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but I was so nervous about flying. \ Don't worry. It will be okay. Flights are always safe
I found that out, after many sleepless nights. Now we fly all the time and I love it. I feel kind of silly. \ Its natural. Do not sweat it.
I think I did very good at my interview. I hope they call me back! \ Good luck. That's always nerve racking waiting for them to call. I'm sure you did well though.
I have a really good feeling about this place though :) \ That is really exciting. I bet since you have a good feeling, they will call back.
i was schocked to see my favorite band wasnt coming to my city this tour \ What band is that?
coldplay \ They playing anywhere close?
After a long week at work, I am at peace on this quiet Sunday morning. \ thats good.. any plans
nothing but just relaxation \ thats cool
Driving sometimes gets me very nervous. I don't like the thought of getting in a deadly car accident. \ how long have you been driving
Since I was 16, I'm 22 now. But I still get very anxious on the road. \ ah thats cool
it upset me to see that my dog to loose the other day \ Wait, what happened?
he opened the gate and ran away \ How did he manage to open the gate?
My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down. \ That will be *such* a wonderful feeling when you do. I know it's hard when you see someone reach the "finish line" first -- are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?
I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it! \ See? That's terrific! And she's got to love that you can celebrate her victories too -- even more inspiration to support yours!
I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating. \ I'm like that too, so I can totally relate. Were you able to talk to him about how you felt?
Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold. \ I've felt the same way. As I have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself, those other insecurities and fears dropped off. Good for you for conquering that challenge!
I was in the mood to try some baking the other day, and I tried something really challenging.  It actually turned out pretty well. \ That's good, new experiences can lead to new likes and dislikes. The important thing is that you keep an open mind. 
That's true.  It helps when the results taste good, too! \ Exactly, hopefully you found a new hobby.
I gave a long, drawn out presentation at school the other day. I found the task to be very daunting. \ That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?
Horrible, my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds. \ Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?
My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us. \ Oh, that must be exciting! I bet you were busy making preparations.
I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby. \ That sounds like it was a lot to take in! Congrats to them!
I was able to make it through some hard times when my parents were able to lend me some money to finish college. \ That was really nice of them and lucky they were able to help you.
Yes, it was. It was a life changer that got me on my feet so I could be able to enjoy life. \ Congratulations on graduating college and I wish you the very best.
I cosigned a loan with my son, expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month. \ wow.. what do you plan to do ?
I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money, but he wastes it. \ yea i can understand that
i was suprised when i saw this guy dunk the other ball the other day \ That's cool! Do you play basketball frequently?
i used to in my younger days.. im old now so i just watch \ I feel the same. I used to be pretty athletic, but now I take in most sports from the comfort of my sofa!
My ex girlfriend messaged me yesterday out the blue, i still do love her im just afraid of trying this all over again \ I would try again, if you love her you might regret not giving it another try if she moves on.
You are right , im just gonna take baby steps and not rush anything and make this work again \ Sounds like a good idea to go slow and make sure things don't get too heavy too fast.
I feel like most of my friends are married with kids and as a single person I have no one to socialize with. \ I dont have kids either, sometimes when i go out with my friends im mainly the 3rd wheel and it feels weird , i feel your pain
It's like, ok I'll go to your kids recital but when will you guys come to the bar with me lol. \ Thats exactly how i feel, i have hanged out with them and its always kids crying and running around
I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet! \ Oh really? How did it go?
I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long.  \ Great job! I'm so happy for you! Losing weight is hard!
I just finished signing the papers for my auto loan refinance! Waiting on a large refund for the GAp insurance! \ Great! Will this mean a lower car payment for you? 
Yes! And a lower interest rate. I'm so happy. I can really use that extra money! \ So happy for you! Yes- having extra money is always a reason to celebrate!
I try not to judge often...but if there's one thing I can't stand it's pedophiles..they just make my blood boil \ I watched a movie based off a true story on that once. It was truely a sad story for the little girl and her parents.
What movie was it \ It was a korean movie. Don't recall the name.
There are 2 cats that come by my home every night. I leave food out for them. \ That's pretty sympathetic of you...but aren't you worried they'll start going through your trash
They haven't yet. I hope not! \ Do you own any cats or dogs
My friend got accepted into Harvard University. That's my dream school. I don't understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there, and i'm stuck at community college. \ Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.
That's what i'm thinking, it's not what you know it's who you know. \ Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to.
My cousin didn't even told me he was having a kid, I had to hear it from someone else. \ Did you guys ever fall out?
No we didn't, I was just surprise, didn't see it coming. \ Wow, it's always the people that your closest to that end up changing.
I booked a vacation house on the coast and we drove to the place. Upon arriving the driveway was blocked with other people's cars, to which none of the owners were anywhere to be found. \ That must have been so frustrating!!! Were you able to find them fairly quickly? And how?!
We did not, instead we had to park very far away and walk the rest for the first entire day. Eventually the people came back and moved the cars in the middle of the first night so we had to sacrifice more time the next day to retrieve our car. \ SO frustrating. Hopefully you were able to provide feedback to the owner. Not sure they could/can *do* anything about it, but still -- maybe you've helped pay it forward to the next visitor!
I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice! \ That sounds exciting! Congratulations to her. I bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!
Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her! \ I bet! But at least now, like you said, she can see what hard work can achieve. Hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hope(d) for!
I am feeling positive about the economy these days \ That's terrific! Is there anything in particular that makes you feel good about it?
All the indicators are positive.The economy is triving. \ But on a personal level, how do you experience that?
I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were. \ Did that person betrayed you in any way?
Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own "vision" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know? \ Don't be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people.
I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will! \ I love reuniting with old friends, helps me remember and appreciate the good times.
I agree. We went to high school and middle school together. \ I bet that was a long time ago!
I can't stand it when you talk to someone who doesn't know a lick of English. It makes everything so difficult... \ Language barriers can be pretty problematic. Always keep an open ear, though.
Yes, I know. I try my best to understand what they are trying to say but it's annoying. \ That's fair. The same would be true in any other nation.
In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so. \ I'm sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! I'm positive you nailed it.
I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive. \ Being competitive isn't a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life. 
I am about to book a vacation to Barbados! I cannot wait to go there. It's going to be gorgeous. \ You are so lucky! I love the Caribbean but I have never been to Barbados. Have you been there before?
I have never been there. I went to Saint Lucia for my honemoon and I loved it! \ Saint Lucia is absolutely beautiful. You were very lucky to go there.
I have my final exam for Linear Algebra coming in a week. I feel stressed out as I am not prepared \ Try to relax and think positive, visualize yourself acing the test.
I think i am going to fail this test as there are much to learn but no time left to comprehensively study \ You are being to negative.Whit this attitude, you are gonna fail for sure
I trust President Trump all the way \ It seems he is delivering on his promises. As you can see, the economic numbers are truly high
I give the credit more to Obama than Trump.The economy is doing great despite Trump \ I think the tax cuts has made investors bullish on capital investment which Trump administration has passed as a law
A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait! \ How did you meet your friend?!
She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south. \ College and high school friends are always close to the heart. I'm glad she lives fairly close!
I am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately, and the doctors have not found a treatment yet. \ That is unfortunate. I hope that it is able to be treated well.
Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun. \ I hope it goes as smooth as possible. Hang in there.
I was expecting to get a low B or even a C in one of my hardest university courses. Instead, on the Final Exam there was bonus opportunity to which I came out with an A average. \ Nice, I bet you feel so relieved!
It was definitely not was I was expecting. It made me understand that there's always a second chance to do well. \ I agree, second chances are awesome. They always surprise me because I don't expect much after the first chance.
I hate wasps so much. They always seem to get into my apartment somehow and I turned into a little girl! \ Oh wow, I bet that's scary. Maybe there's something you could look into to help prevent that happening, that does not sound fun!
I've been looking into bug sprays and bug repellants but nothing has changed. I think it's time to call the exterminator! \ I agree, get those things OUT! I hope they never come back!
i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product \ A duplicate? Like a fake?
yes i received a fake product , the make of earphones is very well known brand  \ That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.
My cat died :( \ oh when and why?
She had diabeties. \ oh my condolences for you, you would have good memories of it.
I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs. \ Wait, were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest.
I know -- I needed to just come out and say "when we had to put them down". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough. \ It's like losing a family member :(
I can't wait until Halloween. I love scaring the little kids who come to my house, muhahah! \ Ha! I've always loved the more festive Dia de los Muertos approach to the day rather than scare or gore! What's your favorite Halloween film?
I remember learning about the Day of the Dead festivities in school, it was very fascinating. My favorite Halloween film is Halloween, lol.  \ SAME. Because when it came out, it felt groundbreaking! I remember being soooo scared and jumpy for weeks after seeing that.
My vacation is coming up in a month. I've worked nonstop for 9 months. \ Wow, I'll bet you're ready for a vacation. Are you going anywhere special?
Just going up north to Canada. Trying a new change of scene. \ That should be awesome. Do you know anyone in Canada?
I flew back to California a few weeks ago, it was beautiful flying in over the mountains. \ It sounds beautiful and serene.
It really is, I miss the Sierra Nevadas very much, have you ever been?  \ No I haven't. But now I want to see.
My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now. \ What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?
No, he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help. \ That is very bad. Unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with
The %4.1 US GDP growth for this year that was revealed is truly unbelievable. Who could have imagined such a number \ I did not know that it was that high! That's amazing.
I think Trump is truly delivering on his campaign promises and everybody is really surprised \ I guess so, and I am not even a Trump supporter.
I hate bugs and insects so much. I've called pest control but I still have them everywhere in my house. I'm so scared of them crawling around all the time... \ I bet that disturbing and frightening when you have to see those. Especially when the thought of them is always lingering!
Yeah, I don't like the idea of them crawling around when I'm sleeping or something. Keeps me always afraid and on alert! \ Hopefully you don't wake up and ruin your sleep over them too often.
I was able to get an interview for a great job, by the time I was going into it I felt that I knew everything they would require and I was not worried at all. \ Nice! You sound like you prepared very well
I did, I prepared in every way possible. It was all worth it in the end because I was able to show them just how valuable I was. \ I love that feeling. Being prepared for whatever comes your way, good luck!
I get so mad when I see or hear about kids getting bullied. It is so unfair. \ it definetly is. I'm glad schools are taking a stance against it
I've seen videos on the internet where kids are crying to their parents that they were made fun of because their race and health illnesses. Very messed up. \ it definetly is. I hope we move forward to eliminate this issue
I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs, my friends made it to 15. :( \ How did they lose so much weight compared to you?
i guess they worked harder but \ Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?
I was walking home from work late a few weeks ago and my street was unusually quiet.  \ What happened?
Well, there was a man walking really quickly behind me and there was no one around.  \ Sounds a bit scary.  What did you do?
I panicked and he caught up. He walked by quickly and said a really nasty word in the creepiest way. But he kept going.  My knees were shaking.  \ Oh my goodness I would have been terrified!
Yes, it was so scary. My heart pounded for at least half an hour. I was shaken.  \ Thankfully he walked on past you but what a horrible experience all round.
I had the worst day ever yesterday.  I had just finished a long, hard day at work, I had driven the 40 minutes home, was just driving into my street and realised that I had left my bag with phone, purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office! \ Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?
Well I wanted to cry and scream, I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol. \ Ah yes, a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still, what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. 
Exactly, so irritating.  But hey you live and learn, I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me! \ I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! 
I've been making music for over a decade, but still hasn't had success like some who've only been doing it for a year or two \ Making music is a hard business to break into. The only way to make it is to keep practicing and to get a little lucky.
I believe you on the get lucky part, but you're right, there's always room for improvement. \ Even if nothing ever comes of music, you're still having fun I hope! Thats really what music is supposed to be about anyways. Making a few million is always a nice bonus though!
Yes, it is, Thank You. \ Of course. Good luck with the music career. I'm rooting for you
My wife is about to start her Master's program and I'm very proud of her. I like how much ambition she has. \ Wow, that's awesome and great that you're supporting her also.
She's my rock. She's going to crush this Master's program \ What course or field?
Hi friend, you should have seen what just happened to me.. \ what happened?
I done slipped and fell all over the ground, it was so embarrassing. \ Oh my, I hope you are ok.
I went to a hot rod show yesterday and saw a bunch of classic mustangs. \ Cool, do you like older cars?
Yes.  I was amazed at all the level of detail in the restorations. \ Was there any bikes there too?
I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card. \ Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?
No not at all, She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday. \ So, it was your partner who used you card
This year, the company I work for, provided with 10 days of paid vacation. I took a trip to Miami. It was amazing to visit the beaches \ Oh wow. I bet that was amazing!
Indeed. In this hot summer season, it was timely and worthy to visit Miami \ I bet the weather was nice too!
one month back i went for a wildlife safari , where i was attacked by a wild boar  \ Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
ya i had bruises on my leg  \ That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?
it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience. \ Are you willing to go on another safari?
no i am done with such trips. \ I'm not surprised.
I finally got my CCNA certification. \ oh that sounds good 
I hope to put it to use soon. \ ya you should and you be proud of your achievement 
I  had no income to pay my bond.  So I accepted the plea bargain just to get out of county jail sooner than later \ That's a wild occurrence. Jail can be harsh on anyone.
yeah, especially if you believe you are 100% innocent of the charges.  However a $600 fine and to be released sounds better than 2 months sitting in jail awaiting a court date. \ Yeah that's definitely the way to go. Get out as fast as possible.
I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping, too! \ Getting out of town and way from all of everday life's struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to 'really' get away from everything for a minute?
Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more. \ That sounds like a really relaxing time, I'm jealous.
I felt like vomiting when I saw a little boy at a restaurant drooling while his parents did nothing. He was eating but his drool and snot from his nose was leaking into his food! \ Oh no! That's disgusting. They should take better care of him.
I was so disgusted and lost my appetite. \ I would have been nauseous too.
When my friend went on bed rest during her pregnancy, I was confident that she would have a healthy baby. \ Is bed rest where you stop working?
Yes, but she was concerned about her baby. I was very optimistic for her. \ Me too. If she gets plenty of rest, the baby will be just fine.
Just got offered a car as a gift. I really needed it. \ What an amazing gift to be given!  That truly sounds like a blessing for you.
It is! The person is very kind to have reached out like that. \ For sure!  Did you accept the gift?
My mother in law always lies and exaggerates things.  Sometimes the same story is told two different ways to both my husband and I. \ I'm glad you and your husband communicate enough to know that!
It's frustrating though, never knowing how she's going to interpret something and then share it with others.  Some of the things she's told our kids have been just horrible. \ What do you say to your kids to deal with it?
We paid 600$ for a cruise, but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad \ No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!
we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for \ I hope that you win your money back and then some, you really deserve it after all of that upset!
It took 2 months of constant waiting for me to get my results for a test that I spent 3 months preparing for. \ sounds like a lot of waiting. did you do well?
Yes, I was able to pass. But the wait in between just built up every single day that went by without seeing those results. \ very frustating but congratulations on the results
Hi friend I will be meeting with one of my old friends today and am every excited! \ Hey, that's good I hope both do a lot of catching up 😊
Yes there will be much to talk about and we will go to the zoo together too. \ I haven't been to the zoo in a long time, I hope you have fun.
one time I was on a boat and got stranded at see. \ Oh man, did you have plenty of food and water?
Nope, we didn't walk with any, wasn't expecting. \ Dang well its a good thing that you made it out okay!
I'm so embarrassed. I just ate an entire bag of potato chips in one sitting! \ Don't worry, I do that all the time. I love binge eating lol
I just feel guilty. I should have eaten a peach. \ True but chips taste sooo much better
I was expecting so much more from the movie but it sucked! Never again am I having my expectations so high for a movie.. \ It's awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and it's a bad time. Did they put all of the best moments in the trailer?
ACtually, the trailer was better than the movie. The movie was sooo weak. \ I would be so annoyed. You could have stayed home and watched Twitch.
I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon. \ Lovely.  What did you do together?
We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends. \ Sounds like a great time.  What has brought that memory back up again>
My husbands brother was getting married.  I searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress.  I finally found it, tried it on and loved it.  I couldnt buy it until the following week as I had to wait to payday so I left it over in the store.  The next day my sister in law called in.  She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment. \ That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.
Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day... \ That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.
