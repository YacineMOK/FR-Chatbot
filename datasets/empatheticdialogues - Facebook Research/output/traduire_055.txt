I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years. \ How awful! how do you feel about it?

I do. He was the one that told me to kill my family. \ He sounds like a bad influence
Thats what the shrink said. They gave me pills to get rid of him. But I didn't take them. \ Good, don't get rid of the only friend you have

I forgot my speech at the investor meeting today. I started sweating and stuttering so badly ugh! \ Did you have notecards?

I've been taking care of my aging mom for 5 years now and don't really have any friends, since so much time is used taking care of her. \ That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class.

I agree, I feel ashamed now. \ It's hard to hold back the truth sometimes.
I have to make a six layer bean dip later. \ Sounds like a lot of hard work.
I am sure it will be good. \ i agree.
My brother was in a drunken mood last night. He said nasty things and broke my furniture  \ That's not acceptable even if he is drunk.
I agree, I am so angry with him. He has been doing for years now.  \ I hope you get to set him straight somehow.
My dad gave me this necklace and I wear it every single day now. \ You must be very happy now.
Yeah I really like it. \ I hope you keep it forever.
I look after my sister whilst my parents were away. \ thats good of you
Thanks I appreciate it. \ yea no problem

I am so hurt over it. \ yea hopefully you find it

I can't believe I am up so early, it's the weekend! \ I know. It seems like I've been up early every weekend for a while now. Really wish I could sleep in!
I told myself last night I would sleep in but I guess my body doesn't want to \ What can you do when your body refuses to cooperate, eh?
I walked into a final knowing that I was gonna fail and it was so nerve wracking. \ Why were you so down on yourself about failing?
It wasn't so much that I was gonna fail as know that I had to sit in there for hours and I was gonn fail anyway. \ Thats not a great attitude as you at least must give a go. You only fail if you don't try.
I find it hard to be faithful \ To your partners, you mean?
Yeah cause I love women and can't seem to settle for one.  \ You should find a way to be satisfied with just one person.
Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness. \ Dang that's really annoying.  Is your insurance going to cover it?
Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation. \ Yeah dealing with an accident is one of the most aggravating things.
My Mother in Law offered to buy us almost all the furniture for the nursery. \ That's a great gesture! Is this for your first child?
Yes, we weren't expecting it so it was extra nice! \ Definitely. Congratulations and good luck!
i stole some money from my parents when i was a kid \ Why did you do that?
i was dumb and young \ Yeah, we all were at some point.
My neighbor left feces on my lawn. \ thats disgusting
I am so irritated about it. \ i would be to
I love when my kids are asleep \ Oh really? Why is that? Because you don't have to deal with their antics while they're knocked out?
Exactly. Somebody gets it. They ar just so sweet and quiet then lol \ I can imagine. Fortunately, I don't have any kids yet, so I do not know the pain of dealing with a bunch of crazy kids! Although, it must be very rewarding.
Have you ever stubbed your toe before? I did this morning when I got out of the shower and it felt like my life flashed before my eyes. \ It is one the worst pains. You would think we'd keep our toes more protected
I know!!!! I am defintiely never wearing sandals again. I discovered that my feet are far too fragile. \ Stepping on legos are just as bad. and they are my kids' favorite toys!
I have never been  this unhappy in my whole life \ I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to talk to a professional about that?
I will try but it's my brother he took a car I saved so much to buy and had an accident with it  \ That's terrible. I hope the situation sorts itself out.
I let a friend watch my dog for a week while I was out of town. I would've been devastated if anything happened to him. \ trust your god feeling, everything will be alright
I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him. \ Did you buy all the essential items the dog will need? 
My mother needs a liver transplant. \ That's intense, what for?
She drank too much during her youth.  I am so sad thinking about it. \ That's awful, I hope she turns out alright.

Yeah I definitely was on that specific test. \ I am proud of you!
I really needed to workout one day since I skipped the day before. I quickly made a meal and then a protein shake to get ready. \ That's good! Keep it up. It's hard to follow routine sometimes
Yeah definitely, I get unmotivated sometimes. \ It'll pay off in the end
I should be asleep right now! It's the weekend \ Same here, though it is the summer for me.
For me too, I guess my body doesn't need any more rest \ I guess so, though I'm tired so I want to sleep.
I get annoyed when I see over weight people \ LOOOLLL I'm the same way I hate their lack of willpower!
I just don't understand why they let themselves go. \ Yeah at what point would you not look yourself in the mirror and be disgusted?
I think they like what they see. \ I think people find a way to lie to themself, and convince themselves that it isn't that bad.  body dismorphia.
My dog has cancer, and he's starting to walk around really slowly. \ So sorry, that must be devastating for you. 
Yeah it's tough to kind of see him on his last leg. \ How long does he have left?
I get embarrassed when I have to get intimate  \ Why do you get embarrassed?
I'm not sure if I'm any good at it and am always evaluating my performance.  \ I bet you are great at it!
I saw a man eat a handful of roaches. \ Yuck thats disgusting, did you throw up?

I watched as the knife cut my buddies arm wide open. \ omg it must have been quite an experience for you
I was disraut, I couldnt believe my eyes. \ I hope he is alright now
How can I ever believe in people again \ What do you mean? is everything okay?
I borrowed money to a friend and he travelled out of the country and never returned \ WOW! he never came back? thats hilarious and terrible.
I was saying goodbye to all of my friends like I would never see them again. \ Oh that's sad, are you going somewhere?
It was the last day of school, It was such a bittersweet moment. \ Oh yeah I remember that.  Pretty tough.
I finally got a time with my buddy to go camping in a couple weeks! \ Yes! me and my buddy go camping every year when it cools off.
Yeah that's what we were waiting on, I'm pumped. \ Yeah its been WAY to hot here lately to do anything.
On my first big rollecoaster of my life, and the loop was coming up. \ That sounds so scary!

So, here I was home from work. My new husband and dad were remodeling tour trailor's bathroom. I went to change to help. A little green lizard was on my shirt. In an INSTANT this yucky thing JUMPED on my head. I screamed so bad my dad said "I think you better go check on your wife." \ That sounds so frightening! Was your husband helpful?
No! He just sat there laughing as I screamed for him to find that lizard. Reptiles are gross to me.  \ I agree! I would have been screaming, too! (And I would have been annoyed at my husband for laughing!)
I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself. \ Oh My Goodness! How wonderful!!!! That is so awesome! Congratulations. 
Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me!  \ Wow! I better! I Stopped at Associates of General Studies, because I wanted to be a mom more. So that is a HUGE step for you! 
Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!  \ This is TRUE! I am glad to be at home with these guys right now. Have a great day! 
My best friend just sent me the, oh nevermind not tonight text again. \ Sorry to hear that, thats disappointing when people pull out last minute.
I know! no warning, I was all dressed ready to go to. \ Did you let them know how you felt?
I get excited around men and not sure if I might be gay \ Yes may very well be gay. Nothing wrong with that.  Ive had alot of gay friends.

I came home to find all of my online shopping at my front door. \ Were you excited or annoyed that the driver left them there?
Very happy1 \ I know the feeling when you get the items you ordered. I think the anticipation os more exciting then actually having them.
Dogs are so caring and lovely \ yes they are so soft and fun to cuddle to.
I just feel the love and joy when I'm around them. I wish I could feel the same around people. \ HA if only, If only people told you what they wanted like dogs do.

I wish I could be like that normally instead of a insecure mess. \ Yeah, I know that feeling.
It took an hour for my pizza to get here. \ Wow thats a long time to wait for pizza.
I am so upset by the slow service. \ did you complain? Or at least ask for a discount.

I was devastated when my aunt died alone. She had a heart attack and no one was there for her. \ I'm so sorry, how sad.  Do you wish you had been with her to say goodbye.

I was in the mall yesterday, here in the small town where I moved las month,  when I met a school frien I hadn't seen in years. \ That is always nice. Were they excited to see you?

I spilled my whole cup of coffee on myself at work yesterday \ oh my god man, was it hot?
Yeah pretty hot. Thankfully I live close enough that my boss let me go home and change mt clothes \ imagine having a mean boss and having to wear that all day ha

I recently moved to a new city and I don't have any friends here \ I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking up organizations in your new area to meet people with similar interests?

I finally made my own pizza. I think it's gonna be good. \ That's impressive, was it difficult to make?
Yea, the dough was. I'm not really good at kneading it seems. \ I guess it probably requires a lot of practice to get the technique down.
I went to the doctor recently for my annual check-up, I always think they're going to tell me something's wrong. \ Check-ups can be nerve wrecking sometimes.

I work a lot, but I'm not worried. My wife is amazing and would never cheat on me.  \ That is good. I am glad to hear that you are comfortable with life.
Yeah I'm a really lucky guy! \ I am sure your wife feels that she is the lucky one.
As soon as my husband gets home from work, I have to leave to go to work. \ That really stinks. Maybe  you both can take some time off of work and be together?

My friend, he won the 100 metre sprint carnival. \ Oh, nice. Well, if you work upon on something, anything is possible if you work upon it. 
My dog is getting older and is starting to walk a little slower these days. \ Sorry to hear that. Are you taking him to the vet?
I haven't in a while, but I definitely should. I don't think there's much they can do though \ I understand. That is life.
A coworker helped me move to another city. He was so kind. \ That's really nice of them, did they help you move your heavy appliances and stuff too?

I'm happy that I've got more maturity and self-discipline than most of my friends.  Based on my bank account and current income I can tell hen it's a good time to party and when it's a good time to stay in.  This situation also explains why most of them are broke and I'm not. \ thats cool
Yup. Are you staying in or going out tonight \ im staying in.. its raining cats and dogs
i loved taking care of my sisters pet \ What type of pet
its a bearded dragon \ Oh that's pretty cool...is it full grown or still a baby
I'm am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital. \ oh no.. what happeneed
He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there. \ ah i hope it all turns out well for you all
i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door \ I would have been too. Were you at a store parking lot or at work?
walmart parking lot  \ That is so awful. I guess they didn't bother to leave a note?
Last week I had a wardrobe malfunction at work. \ what happened
My dress got shut in my car door and then it ripped as I tried walking away. \ oh dang that stinks
i was irked when i couldnt get the day off \ Why? What was going on?
too much work to have time off approved  \ That's disappointing. 
My coworker always seems to due my job better than me. She's nothing special so I'm so upset about that.  \ What kind of work do you do
We are both sales reps at a car dealer.  \ Well I'm sure you've both got your own unique skills...what would you say are 3 things you do well?
I'm amazed at how much better I've gotten at writing lyrics in just 6 months it's crazy. \ That's really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write?
I write mainly hip hop lyrics.  Not the dumb commercial trap rap, more introspective stuff  \ That's really great!
I made a mistake at work. My manager have set a meeting to talk about it. I am a little bit worried. \ what do you think is going to happen?
I don't know. My manager seemed a little bit angry. \ ah well good luck
i was hoping to get the day off \ Why do you need a day off?
so i can go clubbing \ Nice. Some leisure time is always good.
The lottery ticket I bought last night did not win. \ Haha, well that's to be expected I guess. Do you play the lottery often?
Rarely do I bother buying one. \ I think it's fun to buy one every now and then, but wouldn't be my go-to for entertaining gambling.
I ordered pizza and it should be here any moment. I keep looking out the window to check, and I can feel my brain slowly turning into a caveman brain I'm so hungry. \ Yum that sounds delicious. You're making me hungry.
Aha, I'm sorry! If it makes you any less hungry it's a vegetarian pizza because the wife doesn't eat meat. \ You should just get a half vegetarian. No need to punish your self like that.
I used to get excited over getting girls' numbers...nowadays I get excited over free cash and paying off credit card bills \ yea tell me about it... im still paying off cc's from when my wife and i were dating :p
Haha wow that's commitment right there \ heh
i cant wait for monday! \ Why's that
kids start school \ Oh I feel ya.  No kids yet so I'm soaking up all the freedom I can hahaha
I draw for about an hour almost every day, and I've been doing it for a long time. I only ever just wanted to be able to draw fun doodles, but the other day I looked and I actually feel good about my drawing skills, finally. \ That's great. Practice makes perfect.   
It really does! It was miserable starting because you put so much effort into something you don't even like the end result of, but it's well worth it. \ Keep at it. Maybe one day you can start selling those drawings for money.
I was pretty anxious on my first day of work. It was like a new world I was entering. \ I can imagine, and how did things go?
It went well. I was nervous but I got through it. \ Great, it is true that new places and situations can be exciting but scary at the same time
I can't believe that my friends are travelling to Russia to watch the soccer World Cup final! \ Oh wow, that has to be a bucket list item for sure.
They won tickets in some contest, I wish it has been me! \ That would have been fun, maybe next year
heh .. it was ok but kinda boring in a theater \ I am not good with horror movies.  I might have to admit that I am not as tough as I pretend to be I guess.
i was upset when i couildnt leave work \ I can understand.  Then are times when I want to get out of work too.
yea .. i mean the work is going to be there waiting for me the next day..  \ Sometimes it is helpful to take a break and go home early.  It allows you to kind of reset.
Whew! Finally got to mow my horribly large yard before it got too tall and it starts raining \ thats awesome.. how long did that take
Over an hour , but in this heat it makes it very exhausting \ yea i can understand that
i was happy to see i got next week off! \ I hope it's paid too.
yes it is! \ Are you going somewhere for a vacation?
I really liked fossils so I went to my local museum. It was pretty cool and they had a lot of awesome fossils.  \ I love fossils!
Yeah they are pretty great! \ What do you like about them>
I was upset when my family kept leaving me on vacation \ That is really upsetting!
It was. I just wanted some quality family time. \ Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them
i cant wait for monday! \ What's going on Monday?
kids return to school! \ Yeah, I guess that will be like a vacation for you.
I had my transmission fluid changed today. Hope I did the right thing. \ why would it be wrong?
Afterwards I thought I heard in the past that it has to be done very carefully. Can't remember exactly.  \ ah yea it happens
My cousin and I used to beat eachother with sticks. \ for fun?
Yeah. We called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection. \ well that sounds pretty fun!
I was very well prepared for my law exam. \ Were you satisfied with the results?
I was! 95% \ Excellent!
I found out my dog has cancer today \ Oh no! Is it serious?
I'm not sure how bad it is yet. Have to wait for tests to come back \ Well I hope that it isn't serious and your dog makes it through
I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting. It was really awesome! \ Congradulations.  I assume it comes with a pay raise.
Yup and a corner office too! \ with a window?
Yup it's a great view too! \ Awesome.  I'm almost a little jealous
i was sad when i couldnt go home on time \ what do you mean? did you get stuck somewhere?
got stuck at work working on a file \ lammee, did you atleast finish up the file?
My buddy started to turn pale, I just envisioned him throwing up all over my car. \ did you throw him out?
I couldnt,  didnt have the heart I tried to push his head out the window as best I could. \ did it work?
A friend of mine died Thursday and I hadn't called her in about in a month \ That's terrible! I'm really sorry to hear that, but even if you could have said something it doesn't just make it better.
I couldn't be around her much because she on pills really bad. \ Is that what happened to her? My mother was like that as well. It's terrible to watch somebody you loved turn into someone else because of an addiction.
I'm just thinking about quitting my job. My boss is the worst; every time he asks for my idea, if it works it becomes "his" idea and if it fails it's "your" idea. \ That would be annoying. If there is anybody over him, you might try reporting it first.
I'll try that first, but it's hard to report someone for just being really terrible in general. \ Lol , Maybe you could ask for another department
Nothing like a fresh pair of Air Nikes to make me feel ready to take on the world \ Man I have recently been getting into shoes, I dont have nearly as many as some of my buddies,  need to step my game up.
Some ppl think you need 20 different pairs.  Me I just need 2-3 with good arch support and knee comfort and I'm gold \ I just like the style, I want to show off with ever outfit.
I tried to flirt with my crush and completely made a fool of myself. \ Oh hate when that happens.  How did you know you acted a fool
I tried to call her pretty and stumbled over my words. \ You'll figure it out.  I believe in you
Yes, because that's how I feel about it. \ Hello friend! May I ask what it that you feel that way about?
It encourage to be impressed. \ I don't understand what you are talking about. Are you feeling okay today?
Have you ever spilled a bowl of cereal? I did today and I was absolutely so mad! I flew into a blinding rage and started flailing about so bad that I nearly killed myself! \ Wow, why did you involve your self in spilling a bowl of cereal?
I had a bout of butterfingers this morning and couldn't hold onto my bowl! I was so angry that I couldn't eat my cheerios before heading off to work! \ That's very serious. What are you going to do about the bowl now?
My mom has arthritis in her neck, and the pain seems to be traveling down now. \ I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her? 
The doctor just recommended exercise. I'm not sure if they were just busy to do anymore for her or if exercise is the best. \ Usually moving your body helps but it depends on her situation... i would get a 2nd opinion!
I am so impatient right now... waiting for the clock to hit 5 so I can go on vacation!  \ How many hours do you have left?
4 hours to go! ahhh \ haha not bad! where are you going on vacation?
i was scared walking home alone last week \ Why?
someone followed me home \ I hate that. I'm glad you're ok!
I enthusiastically told my family about everything wrong with my life at that point. \ how did it go
Not good. I was very drunk though \ oh well maybe next time
I was a cheater in highs school. I always got some nerd to help me, bet now I really regret it.  \ We all do stupid stuff as kids.  The important thing is you realize how bad that behavior is now.
Yeah, but that  doesn't stop me from being upset about it.  \ I understand regret over previous actions, but you just got to move forward.
My friend got a hole in one the other day.  It was just his second time ever playing golf!  Talk about unexpected. \ Good for him! The only time I've ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game. 
Ha!  Me too.  And I have been playing golf for years.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I saw the ball go in! \ It's definitly a really hard thing to do. Your friend must be really lucky!
My uncle died in a car crash yesterday. \ sorry to hear that
Thanks.  It sucks. \ i can see that
i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery \ You and me both.
heh \ The powerball drawing is tonight ;)
Quitting smoking was so much easier than I expected it to be! \ how many days has it been?
2 years \ wow thats great!
i was upset to see someone put a dent in my door \ Car door?
yea \ When did that happen?
I was grossed out when I saw someone vomit outside a bar. \ Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.
For sure. it was not a pretty sight. \ Some people can't hold their liquor.
I just saw a brown recluse crawling on my desk. \ I just found one in my toilet the other night!
Yikes. I hate them.   I've been bit by one before. \ How bad was it?
Every Christmas song I hear on the radio for some reason reminds me of my extended family back home and the good times we had when I was younger. \ That's really cool that you have those awesome memories. Do you ever go baack and see your family?
No hopefully soon though. Hbu \ Well I hope you have a good time!
I'm am so afraid of the dark. I can't fall asleep so I have to have a light on in order to fall asleep.  \ Have you always had this fear of the dark
Yeah ever since I was a little kid.  \ Is there any specific reason why?
i am hoping to go to hawaii next year \ have you ever been there before? I hear it's great!
No i have never been but i hope i am able to one day. \ Save up and sign up for deal alerts on expedia and other sites. It's really amazing how cheap you can get trips nowadays!
I am anxiously awaiting a second puppy from a dog I rescued. I thought she might be pregnant but then I thought she wasn't after a week.  \ Oh wow, where do you get these pets? from a shelter or off the street?
She was on the streets and starved and trying to get run over. \ oh wow, thats good of you to be able to bring in dogs off the street.
Super shocked when our rescued malnourished dog popped out a puppy when I got up this morning! \ wow thats great, is that the one you got off the street?
Yes! I think she may have another one coming...and I pray not! I have enough dogs :( And a puppy is a lot of work \ well i wish you good luck on that one!
i was pissed when i saw someone had left my gate open and my dog was missing \ Oh my god..I would be too! No locks?
yea but someone from the water company had to get to the back to do something and forgot to shut it when they were done \ Oh...I have locks on all my gates and the companies have to ask for permission. That is terrible! Did you get your dog back?
My new dog keeps trying to sit on her new puppy. It's making me quite upset.  \ Have you tried find a away to keep the seperated?
Yes, I h ave to moniter her all day and it's stressed me out. She is being very obsessive and freaks out if she is away from her puppy....Sigh! \ I'm sure that it will get better. Dogs are really smart so if you keep working with her I'm sure she will get it. 
Yes, she is young..and clearly very neglected as she was starved...Can't even believe she had a healthy puppy..I think something weird happened to her pups before. Poor dog! \ Oh my gosh! It sound like she has a had a rough life. You are great for taking care of her!
I'm nervous about going to work on Monday. I have a meeting with my boss but I don't know what it's about Can you give me any advice? \ I am bad with anxiety too but if you haven't done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and HOPE for the best. You never know- you could be getting a raise!
Yeah I guess that could be true, but my company hasn't been doing well lately and a lot of people have already been laid off.  \ Prepare then and you will feel better- either way it goes you will be prepared- so if it's bad- you will already have known and if it's not- then you will get surprised. Either way it won't rock your world.
Yeah, I just don't want to have to find another job though. I twould mean I may have to move to a different city with my family.  \ Oh man! Well all you can do is prepare early as you just never know! Life isfull of change.
Our new dog who was starved just had a puppy today. We thought she was pregnant before but after a week of food- she seemed to have a normal stomach. \ That's pretty awesome.  What breed
She is a tiny pit bull. A pocket pit! I can't believe she had a healthy puppy after how starved she was. The puppy is small but that could be from her being starved. It looks like a pitbull mix as well. So cute! And very quiet. \ That's pretty generous of you to adopt an abused dog, especially a pregnant one.  That's a lot of responsibility but I love pitbulls too so I would've done the same
I've got more sympathy for poor people who are actually trying to improve their situation, than those who are just looking for a handout \ Well of course..Like all the drunks and druggies begging for money who won't work on my corner? Most people are poor..and work hard!
Agreed.  It's a common misconception to think all poor people are lazy.  Some just have it rougher than others I know I did coming from a third world country.  But now I'm fully self-employed own my own car rent my own apartment and live life on my own terms \ Poor people are the hardest workers in america usually..It's corps that have a HUGE pay gap and the CEOs make ridiculous money while the people keeping the companies don't even make a living wage
I am  the  best  because I was the first in my class \ Cool.  guess now you can be president.
Of course  with my grade I can be predident \ I want to Secretary of Treasury. Is that still a thing?
I ave the worst internet service now \ Really
Its really fast, but it cuts off a couple of times a day and we only have a couple of providers in this area. \ Network do disappoint
I'm so upset. My dog that I've had ever since he was a little puppy just died. We were friends for 20 years.  \ Oh no. I'm sorry :(
Thanks. He was really old and had a lot of health problems so it really was for the best.  \ Pets are great but they sure are tragic.
Life is a lot better when you can eat solid food. Never get your jaw wired shut it sucks. \ I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?
I got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago - still think about it ! \ Man that sounds aweful.
I was thankfully ready for when a puppy came today. I have lots of clean blankets, a clean room and extra money if needed! \ That's good that you were prepared! Puppys can be a handful.
Oh goodness yes...and I just have the momma from the last week! oi! 2 new dogs in a week. \ Man that does sound like a handful!
I am so excited to see my family. I haven't been home in sooooo long.  \ I hear you! Tell me about your family?
Well I have a younger brother who is in high school and I haven't seen him or my parents in a really long time. I feel like I miss so much! \ Why did you move away from home? That is cool to have a brother in highschool. Highschoolers usually aren't home much anyhow 
Its for school. I go to university 1000 miles away  \ Oh my goodness! That would be so hard!!
Well...our abused starved gal had herself a puppy today! I was incredibly shocked. \ You the pitbull guy? haha
GAL! ;) \ Gal :)) what did you end up naming the pup?
I'm feeling pretty blessed these days...I know I can always trace it back to the love, support, and steadfast belief of my parents that I can achieve anything I set my mind to \ It's rare to have great parents it seems, I am glad you have good ones!
They are the best I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them I thank God every day for them. \ I feel the same about my mom! Wonderful! Remember to cherish them daily, as we never know what can happen and aren't promised tomorrow
Super sad this weekend. I wish my partner would be done with therapy already and be home  \ Aww, I hate to hear that. How long have you two been together?
3 years. but I also know I have a lot of ptsd from him and it will be a long road before I am ready to be around him again. But you know...at the same time it's hard!!! \ Well, hopefully when it's all said and done it'll be be worth it. Best of luck with it.
I bought a pomegranate the other day on a whim. I haven't had one since I was a kid, so it brought back from memories when I was snacking on it. \ I have never actually had one of those! We don't get very exotic fruits here in the midwest. What do they taste like?
It's really hard to explain. They're good, but they're kind of tricky to eat, and eat little ball of fruit you eat has a big seed you have to eat around. So think of something tasty that's effort to eat, like sunflower seeds (but better.) The flavor is too unique to explain. \ Never had sunflower seeds. I love Pomegranate juice though. Sounds interesting. Do they taste anything like a watermelon, or more like a raspberry?
Umm, they're kind of juicy the way a watermelon is but actually a raspberry might not be too far from it. I love watermelons, by the way. \ I LOVE watermelon...Geez- I could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself. My complexion always looks better after watermelon too
When I was a kid and people asked what was my favorite fruit, I'd never say watermelon because in my mind that was cheating. OBVIOUSLY watermelon would have to be anyone's favorite. Only later in life did I realize not everyone liked it like I did. \ LOL! I know..my sister hates them..but I don't like most veggies :( Rapsberrys are a close second!
i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery \ Why, the odds are not in your favor
well now you tell me! \ Ha, its never bad to try though
We were going to go swimming today. The weather was bad though so we had to cancel \ so what was plan B?
Stay home and watch tv \ oh that sounds good.
Marvel makes the best superhero movies! I can't wait for the next one to come out! \ When is it due out?
Well the next Infinity Wars is out in 2019 so that's a long time to wait! \ Who is your favorite Marvel hero?
I decided to treat myself tonight and make grill a huge steak for myself tonight. \ That sounds really great and delicious! 
Yeah it would have been if I hadn't burned it to a crisp and turned it into a black charred piece of leather! \ Ohhhhhh yeah that's no good. Still that happens to me all the time so I wouldn't worry too much about it. 
I'm always feeling like I'm on the verge of something awesome about to happen. I don't know what it is it must be the winning streak I'm on these days \ Does anything awesome ever end up happening?
Yes everyday $$$$ \ That's whats up
Life is good right now for me too \ Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you
Right just staying active, don't need much money, minimal drama. Easy \ Absolutely
My friends left him in the middle of the night. I feel sick for him \ who did they leave and where?
Sorry, My friends wife left him in the middle the night. It made me sick \ wow thats crazy.
i was upset when i saw my dog was missing \ Oh no, I hate that
yea, he gone. \ Maybe he comes back or you find him
There's a huge stuffed bear on my yard. \ That sounds creepy
Agree. Not sure what I should do with it. \ I guess ignore it for now
I was really calm today. I just sat on the patio and read \ Sounds like a relaxing day.
It was very much needed \ Is it your day off?
I checked my mail and was so shocked. There was a check with a $1000 in an evelope with my name on it! \ Well that comes in handy.
Yeah I'm a little worried that it isn't real.  \ ah.. take it to the bank to find out
i was happy to see that i was off next week \ That's really awesome! What are you going to be doing with your time?
just chillin is about all i have planned so far. \ Well that's good! A little rest and relaxation is always good!
I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards. \ Things happen that are bad, I am sure it wasnt your fault.
I was distracted by the sound of running water. \ I am sure they forgave you in the end.
I was scared when I had to go to the doctor for a lump on my side. I was really expecting the worst. \ Omg. I know exactly how you feel. I had a lump on my back but got it removed. Turned out to be just fatty tissue. Size of a tennis ball !
It was pretty much the same, just a fatty tumor \ Good deal. I think it was stress related.
I used to feel lonely a lot as a teenager. That was dumb of me \ I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too
I've noticed that it's easier to be happy while not around someone all the time. \ Would you say you're more of an introvert?
Lady Luck is the only woman in my life who hasn't failed me yet (besides my mom lol)...I see a lot of good things in our future together $$$$$$ \ Whys that?
Because my life is the epitome of that Drake song blessings on blessings on blessings ;) \ Excellent
I was scared driving home last night. It felt like I was being followed \ Oh no! Where were you coming from?
The downtown area \ Yikes! Did you get home okay? Normally I weave different ways when I think that
My weekend is going well so far. I am hoping tomorrow nothing bad happens \ I am sure tomorrow will be fine
Well it's been bad sundays for awhile, so I am hoping it isn't this time :) Someone acts up on Sundays...it's ridiculous \ I am sorry, I hope tomorrow is different then
i went into that interview knowing i was going to crush it \ That's great that you were so confident. I wish I could be like that.
Well it didnt start out that way but over the years I have become better at these types of things \ That's great that you have that kind of personal growth
I'm so made at George Lucas. How could he think something like the Phantom Menace would be a good idea for a movie! \ it made him a ton of money so i think thats all that mattered to him at that point cause i agree it was crap.
I don't know I like to think he is better than that.  \ that was back then when he was trying to do something great, the drive isnt there when you have already done it
My friend bought me a programming course. \ that was nice of them.
Yea, it is. I was just talking about how I wanted to learn yesterday, and the next thing is this course in my email. \ always good to have friends like that
i loved taking care of my sisters pet \ What pet does she have?
a bearded dragon \ Oh wow. Don't think I've ever seen one of those.
One big pet peeve of mine is a poor person complaining about his/her situation and doing absolutely nothing to fix it \ i get that. i am in pain every morning and get up and go to work everyday. so it's hard to find sympathy from me
My point exactly.  You're a hard worker despite your physical pains.  I was born in a third world country and am now self-employed with full financial autonomy, my own car, apartment, and supportive friends and family...DON'T TELL ME you can't fix your life. You just don't want it bad enough \ exactly. it really drives me nuts when people feel like they entitled to this or that.
i really wanted to get pregnant but month after month it didn't happen \ Hmm maybe it's not your time yet...I'm sure you'll get there
i'm getting up there in years so i'm kind of at the end of the line. i suppose it may not meant be to be \ I wish you abundant joy, success health and wealth in all areas of your life.
Got a $100 Costco cash card. Gonna spend it all at the food court. \ Awesome. That's a whole lotta pizza slices.
Yes. 10 weeks of pizza goodness! \ Awesome I hope you enjoy it.  Don't get too fat.
My nextdoor neighbor is getting dementia. \ I am so sorry to hear that. Who is taking care of your neighbor?
Her family.. sort of... but not really.. \ That's really sad. Not being able to even know what's going on anymore.
I was speeding, because I was worried about my mom. \ I understand! Did you get in trouble?
The cop actually let me off! \ Good officer for once! That is good to hear!
I am shocked my dog had a healthy baby after being starved for most of her pregnancy! \ Oh no! Why was she starved?
No idea. Her former owners never came forward and they would NEVER have gotten her back anyway unless they had just rescued her. I can't believe they starved her period..but that they starved a pregnant dog! Seriously?? She was so incredibly thin..I could see her entire hip bones and she was RAVENOUS and thirsty for a week! \ Some people should not be in charge of another living being.
August is way too hot. \ Especially in the south
Right. I live as north as you're gonna get in the US and it still sucks. \ Oh wow, that does sound horrible
I was a little sad with the weather today. We had to cancel plans \ Rainy?
Very much so, and the wind was blowing \ Yuck
Life can be hard sometimes or even often.  \ That's true. What's going on?
Just dealing with difficult people. They are everywhere! Even in your own home sometimes!  I just don't understand why people can't just be kind and good and instead want to hurt and destroy \ Some people are only out for themselves unfortunately.
I stayed up all night to decorate the office. \ Oh wow! What does it look like now?
It's definitely ready for a retirement party. I'm gonna miss her. \ Going to miss who?
I am getting a new cat tree tomorrow, it finally went on sale.  \ thats a nice gift for a cat.
It's a gift for me too because I am happy when they are happy. They need one for the cat room bad! One I have wanted for a long time that I see in my pet store! I am not happy unless I get something 80% off or more." \ 80% wow that is cool.
i cant wait for monday! \ What is going on Monday?
the kids are going back to school :p \ LOOOOL! They go back in september here. Oh yey, relaxing time!
You need to be happy for you to live longer \ of course, like they say happiness is contagious, if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young
Yeah for sure, that's why I always like to be happy  \ Also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner
My son won a scholarship so I won't have to spend money on fees. I am grateful  \ Wow that's nice,  he must be very intelligent 
Yes he is, I am also grateful for having such a wonderful wife that teaches and helps him after school \ Awww that's nice,  just take care of them 
Everyday in every way I'm getting better and better.  Still waiting on my big come up but I'm in no rush, just enjoying the view ;) \ That's wonderful to hear!
Thanks.   \ What's been going on in your life?
I miss my coworker. Her replacement just isn't the same. \ Bummer.  You still keep in touch with her or what
Yea. We keep in touch online. She definitely set up some high standards for us around here. \ Nice.  Give the newbie a chance, I'm sure she'll come around.  What kind of work do you do
My external hard disk has stop working. I had very important data on it. It can't be fixed. \ That must be frustrating. What are you going to do now?
I can't do anything to retrieve the data. I had personal pictures and videos on it. I am sad of losing them. \ I'm so sorry that happened. What brand is the HD?
I think I've got popcorn kernels to last me through retirement. I wonder how long they keep for. \ That is nice.
Yea, it is. Do you like popcorn? \ Yes. Why did you bought that many popcorn kernels?
I didn't get a job I interviewed for. \ Dang that stinks, better luck next time.
Yep, I've already got more applicaions out :| \ thats good that you are trying!
i was mad when i saw there was a dent in my car door. \ Do you know how it happened?
nah it was while i was at walmart \ That sucks. I hate people who do stuff like that and don't take responsibility.
I'm so taken by the talents of contestants on the show Face Off -- have you ever seen it? \ I have, thats a very cool show
Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible! \ They are very talented on there
I am looking forward to tomorrow. We are going kayaking \ That sounds like so much fun -- and like a break you're looking forward to, yes?
Yeah, it should be really fun \ Have you been before? It seems like such a great way to both play and get a workout ;-)
My sister n law washed my clothes today for me. It was a nice gesture \ That's very nice of her!
Yeah it was very sweet \ Your brother is a lucky guy!
My brother like spiders but I am scared of them! I can't handle those things! \ I am not sure how anyone could like those things
Yeah I don't know either.  \ I do not like them either though
Even more upset then I already was that the dog I rescued was not only starved but starved AND pregnant. \ That poor dog
I know right? I can't find out who had her but it was someone near me as she was running 2 weeks ago like a demon was after her and almost got hit- No way she was loose for any amount of time but right that moment. \ That all sounds horrible
I was pretty annoyed at the store earlier. The cashiers were being slow \ Did they just not care?
I think so, that must be the case \ Sometimes they are tired at the end of their shift. It happens
Got a lot done this week, made good money, got things I needed, some I wanted and still saved up! \ what are you saving up for?
What am I NOT saving up for is the question, lol. Saving up for any emergency always. They happen a lot in my life. No big upsets though this week, it's been a good week! \ wow i wish i could be like you :)
i was mad when i saw my dog was missing \ Why is he missing and is he home?/
he dug a hole and got out of the backyard and has not returned. \ Oh god, some dogs have to be watched a lot! Watch the shelters and put up flyers everywhere online
I found out a very simple part to my lawn mower is VERY expensive from all the mower parts places.  \ Which part
The recoil puller. Just the cord and casing that makes it start. I was angry because it is literally 5 times the price that it is online from all kinds of stores. I just don't get why they are charging $65 for a little plastic cord??? \ Hm that's pretty useful info right there...you must be quite the handyman/woman, I would've probably just bought another one lol
Nothing pumps me up more these days than money making opportunities where I have full autonomy of time \ I know right? I love the side hustle!
C.R.E.A.M. baby \ No idea what that means but it sounds good! lol
trying to same money for a trip. trying to get pregnant. just lots of stuff \ where do you want to go.
to see my family. they are 800 miles away \ oh wow that sounds cool
im ready for next week! \ what's happening next week?
the kids start school \ aren't we talking about the kids going back to school?
Looking forward to getting my cats a new cat tree tomorrow! It is a warehouse deal so I am hoping it is in good shape! \ I hope the cat likes it
