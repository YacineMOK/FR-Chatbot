She really isn't but I was just so happy with her at the time that it makes me sad. \ Yeah, I can understand your feelings for her.
I feel twinge of envy on my sisiter! \ Oh really? Why do you think that is?

Talent shows in high school and Pep rallies, getting out of class. Just the memories I made with friends I don't get to see now. \ You can always organize a reunion for your former classmates.
Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street? \ That is not very considerate or respectful, plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.
That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors? \ I live in the country, so I do not have neighbors that live close. 
How fortunate, my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories.  \ I sometimes get freaked out, but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. 
That's true. You can live in peace. \ Yes. Peace is key.
My parents were able to pay for me to attend college, however I feel bad for those who were not lucky enough to be born into those circumstances \ Don't feel bad for the opportunity that you have. Life is not set out on an even keel so we all must make the best of our lot.
That's fair, just feels kind of unfair that some people are born into better circumstances. Then again, I guess life isn't fair. \ I'm happy that you have this opportunity in life. Keep at it and be thankful for it.
I feel disgusted when I see or smell any form of thing with bad odour. \ Same, I can never go into public bathrooms for this exact reason. It is amazing how bad it smells in one of those!
I know, I think I might have a phobia or something. It really puts me off. \ Yeah, pretty much all humans would rather smell good things than bad lol. I hope you can get over this phobia though as I know how it feels to just despise something.
My girlfriend (ex now) really bs'ed me since she said that she wasn't ready for a relationship but then she had another boyfriend right after she broke up with me. \ that is a slap in the face.
It really is, it made me feel so dumb for trusting her. \ it happens to the best of us

I ate too many sweets the other day, they were so good though. \ really what kind of sweets did you eat?
I don't remember the name, but they looked like regular cookies.  \ I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite
I was surprised one day I scratched a lotto ticket to find out I had won Â£100. \ So exciting! What did you do with that money?
I was in shock as I've never won anything before. I took the money home and gave it to my wife for the house shopping. \ Thats good! I would have just spent it on drinks!
Ugh some guy in a truck cut me off twice on the interstate yesterday. \ Really! That must have bee so frustrating for you.
Yea and I am so jealous that he drives around in it so recklessly!  \ jealous? Not sure why your jealous of somebody being inconsiderate.
I was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert. \ That sounds like a great place to propose! How did it go?
They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course! \ That's so heartwarming! I hope your relationship works out very well!
I really felt confident that I could trust and love this girl that I used to date. \ You always hope that is the case. Sounds like it didn't turn out well. I'm sorry.
It didn't turn out well since she lied to me, even though I really thought she was truthful. \ That's terrible and really not fair to you. I feel so bad you had to go through that. 
I am looking forward to my job interview tomorrow. I know I will get it. \ Well good luck and I'm sure you will.
Thanks but I won't need it. \ Your very confident. I guess thats a good attitude to have.
I'm somebody that needs to always have everything organised and prepared. \ I wish I was more like that.

Some guy I saw homeless 10 years ago, now makes 100k a year! \ That's so inspiring! How did he do that?

I can't sleep when I'm anticipating a big event or trip thats coming up \ I know what you mean, it's the excitement that keeps you up!
Yes exactly. Its like being a kid and feeling so excited the night before Christmas. \ I would always try to sneak a peak of the gifts when my parents were not looking.
It's not fair that my sister gets to have my mother's favorite necklace! \ I know right. Did your Mum ask you to see if you wanted it also?
My mom knew I was always interested in it, but my mom decided to give it to her when I wasn't around. \ Oh no. I'm sorry. Families can be tough.
I have been looking for a job for months, going on interview after interview and I finally went on one that I am really interested in but I have been waiting all week to find out if I got it or not. \ Ugh, I hate the waiting game. What's the job for? Have you tried calling back and checking in?
Its a teaching job.  I didn't call but I did email the guy and touch base with him.  But he didn't reply :( \ Teaching sounds good. We seriously need more amazing teachers. I'll pray that it will all work out for you. 
I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not. \ Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?
I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said "Special Sister". I'm probably a jerk.. \ Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?
No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet. \ Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.
Hi, so I sit by myself at lunch every day! \ Why?
Because I have no friends. It makes me so lonely and unwanted.  \ That is true?
I gave instructions  \ To whom did you give instructions? 
My subordinate in the office \ Did you feel powerful giving instructions? 
My son have got his engineering diploma last week. I am so happy. \ Excellent, you must feel proud of him as well!
Yes, I am very proud of him. \ As you should be! It takes a lot of hard work.
So I was at the mall yesterday and saw my ex having lunch. \ Did you talk to her?
Yea and it made me feel so nostalgic when we talked about old memories! \ It is nice that both of you still share good memories.
I keep disconnecting from my internet \ I hate it when that happens. Where you doing anything important when it happened?

Studying to be a pharmacist. \ Thats great. Did you ace the test?

The way interest rates are these days, i'm so afraid to go get a car loan \ Financing can be scary but a lot of places now have really great rates for auto loans.

No thats what made it worse to me \ Who needs friends like that. So what did you do? 
I don't feel that people are very trust worthy. \ Why?
I feel that people are always looking out for their own interests and even when they trying to help you, they are in it for their own gain. \ I understand. I have the feeling. Most people are now looking only for their interests.
I like my new manager. He is so kind and a good listener. I feel that I can trust him with any issue that I have. \ Thats great isn't it. I hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen. 
I hate that too. Most of the managers are like that. They never listen and they can be rude. \ I'm happy for you that this new manager is better. It just makes working a whole lot better and more enjoyable.
I let my coworker in on a secret project and he helped me with it! \ I like secrets. Did it turn out the way that you hoped it would.
Yep, it helped that I felt trusting of him. So he performed well. \ It was nice that you had him to turn to for help.
My sister bought tickets for my Mom and I to go to a concert. I wasn't expecting this but was quite pleased \ You must have been rather surprised. Did you thank her for it?

I got a toy for my niece's birthday in the mail and figured I could put it together without any directions. \ Were you able to finish right?

I miss my mother deeply. \ I'm sorry. We're you close?
yes, very much.She was the most important person in my life. \ I can't imagine what that was like. I hope you find peace.

I was ashamed when my mom got arrested \ Oh my, why was she arrested?
She was drinking \ You shouldnt feel ashamed of your moms action. It was not your fault.
How can I trust again when I have ben cheated on thrice \ Sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time. There are good ones. If you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you.
Yes I learnt my lessons \ I know it's hard. Just don't give up. 
After I moved out of state I lost contact with a very good friend. When they tried to reconnect I felt bad about not staying in touch. \ I understand how you feel

It was very fun \ sounds like a good weekend!
I have an important exam tomorrow and feel that something bad will happen. \ What could go wrong when you're taking an exam?

I have a toothache and hate going to the dentist, this will put a damper on my day for sure! \ Ugh dentist visits are the worst. Atleast you can look forward to taking a break from work.
Not when it's the dentist, I'd rather be at work! But my job is an easy one, so. \ Oh yes, but sometimes my boss let me off when I have to go to the dentist!
I bought a new laptop with my first salary. \ That's quite an investment. It must have made you feel good to be buying it with your own money.

My family just left on a trip for a week and I had to stay back to work.  \ Oh that's too bad. How long before they get home?

That's so true! I think they will have fun but I will miss them being all alone in the house.  \ I hope it goes okay and for you the time passes fast! 
The other night my grandma wanted to video chat to say hi to her great grand kids. My four year old was showing off his counting skills and some other cute stuff he had learned. It made my grandma really happy. \ That's so sweet!  Modern technology is amazing, right?!
Oh yeah it's great for her to have a change to see what the kids are up to. But video calling can be really glitchy and awkward too haha. \ Yes that's the bad part.  Was the call that way for her?
Not too bad, but she didn't really notice sometimes that she wasn't hearing certain words correctly. I just went with it haha. \ Ha ha - I'm glad she didn't really notice it!
So I went to see the new Marvel movie with Thanos. It was so good and I am so pumped up now. \ What was it. I've been too busy to notice new movies out.

good idea \ No problem I hope everything works out
Can't wait for summer time to come \ It's summer now for me.

Yes, there was, the town was very damaged. We had sandbagged around our home and managed to save our house. \ Good thing you were prepared.
For tax season this year I had planned ahead of time and was ready. \ It is always good to have things prepared in advance so you can get them done quick and easy.

This is a silly story, but it reminds me how confident teenagers can be. When I got my first tattoo, for some reason, it gave me this false sense of confidence. I am not sure why other than at the time I thought my tribal tattoo was something to admire \ Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?

My coworker stole my presentation idea and claimed it was his, I can't believe it. \ WHAT? did, you have any idea beforehand,  or he just showed up with your idea.

Only next semester. I feel like I have wasted much of my time \ Don't feel too bad.  I had to take college algebra 3 times before I finally passed with an A.  Sometimes you just need a good teacher.
I have been going on interviews for 4 months and today I finally got a job!  I am so happy! \ Congratulations. You finally did it. What is your occupation now?

I found a hair in my food while eating dinner last night. \ That is so gross. I hope you told the manager and got a refund.
Yes and yes.... and do you really want them to remake it?  Nah no thanks. \ Yeah, I would have said the same things. Aren't they supposed to wear hair nets anyway? Thats's not acceptable.
I was shocked when my parents bought me a new car for graduation \ Wow that is a nice surprise! You must have done very ywell.
I suppose so, I just was not expecting it at all \ What kind of car did you get?

I heard that the woods near my childhood home were torn down so they could build new homes. \ I hate to hear that, did you have many memories of playing in those woods?

A character that I loved was killed off of one of my shows that I always watch. I cried like a baby. \ What show is it?
The Walking Dead. It was bound to happen afterall. Didn't make it any less painful. \ Ah, I have heard they are brutal with the killings in that show
A light switch in my house stopped working and I was able to fix it without looking up how. \ Wow, that is impressive. I probably couldn't have done it with a tutorial how. I would have walked around with a flashlight until someone felt sorry for me and fixed it

A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something \ Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.

Yeah, Thanks \ Are you sick or just not feeling well?
Did I tell you about the girl at work who gets everything handed to her? \ No
SheCONSTANTLY has things (big things!) just given to her for no reason! Last week, someone GAVE her a car even though she had a good one already!  \ Really? Why did they give her a car?
It seems every day in traffic i'll let someone out and don't get a wave or anything. \ Thats the worst when you do something for someone and they dont even appear to care! 
No doubt, but i always try to do what i would want someone to do for me. \ Same! Two wrongs never make a right.  You are doing the right thing. 
I came across an old letter from high school from one of my best friends.  \ That's really cool, do you still keep in contact with them?
Barely, things usually change after highschool. Its too bad. It was nice to come across tho and have memories.  \ Yeah for sure, i hardly speak with any of my highschool friends either.

I was disgusted when my dad left me \ Why did he leave you?
I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me. \ That's awful and there has to be another reason for it. I can't stand fathers who behave that way, despicable.

I was super irritated when my boss kept pulling my hair for fun! \ I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.  
He seems to think otherwise for some reason. I am thinking about reporting him to the HR. \ You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you
I am going out to dinner with my wife to a place we haven't been to since I proposed to her. I cant wait. \ Oh wow, that is going to be such a sweet experience!

I really don't know. I woke up at it was tight then it just kept getting worse as day went on. Its been a week now. \ Ohh wow! I hope it gets better for you
I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday \ I can understand that. I don't get nearly as many birthday wishes as I used to. I guess it happens as we get older.

When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years. \ That is understandable.  Such an experience can be tramatic.  Did you eventually learn?
I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did! \ My wife had a similar experience, she still doesn't drive.  Good for you for overcoming it.
I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant. \ That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?
Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident. \ At least you saved money doing it yourself!
I am having a job interview tomorrow and it is my first interview ever  \ Are you nervous about it? I know I was when I had my first interview.
Oh yeah i was. I have read a lot of books about this and yet it will not help \ The best thing to do is not worry and just remember what you want to say to the interviewer. You will do just fine!
I buy a lottery ticket every day but for some reason I have not won more than $10. My luck will soon change! \ Well You can be hopeful. But i think you should  stop gambling

A friend of mine borrowed my mower this past weekend, which he brought back broken. \ Did you ask him to replace it?
He said it wasn't his fault and it just stopped working. Of course the blade is bent, so I think he might be lying. \ I agree with you there, I would ask him to pay honestly
In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper. \ Oh wow! that stinks. Im sorry

They just moved in too. I hope it was just a housewarming and not a regular occurence \ I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! 
I am so sad lately.  My husband needs a lung transplant and he is only 40 years old. \ Oh wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. Was this an all the sudden thing or has he been in poor health?
It has been happening gradually over a number of years he has a genetic form of COPD and has never smoked or done anything to deserve this. \ It's so hard how that usually is the case. Never deserved. Is his surgery scheduled soon?
He just got put on the list for the transplant so now he has to wait until its his time. \ I'm really sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through. I'll be praying that he will get his lungs ASAP and that in the meantime, you'll feel at peace.
Thank you so much! I appreciate your prayers! \ You're welcome. :)
Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape? \ All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.
Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back.. \ I know what you mean.  However, the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.

I went to the county fair last night with my family. \ That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time?

I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times! \ I bet! Im sorry you are feeling down.

my neighbor keeps borrowing my shopvac and she never returns it on time \ You may want to think about not letting her borrow it anymore.  Sounds pretty rude to me.

My first cat disaapeared 2 years ago after 14 years with him \ That's so sad. I just had a cat disappear, it's quite sad.

my friend went back with her ex again.  \ Ouch, that could be bad.  What was her reason?
She lacks confidence. I don't think it's going to end well. \ That's a tough thing to watch happen.  Just be there to support her when she needs it.

It was pretty awesome, I showed up in school after they had gotten paid and he was getting out his wallet. He said he had something for me but it felt better telling him I didn't need it they hired me on full time. \ Getting the full-time sounds better taking a one time bonus from him.
I made some cookies from scratch and left to run an errand. When I came back my family had eaten most of them without asking. \ Oh my god, fresh cookies that you hand baked?? What did you do?
I hid the rest of them away so only I get to eat the rest. \ HAHAHAHAHA  that what my niece does, I bring home two candies and she talks me into giving her one then she hides the other when i'm not looking

It was pretty easy she just moved in to my place. \ Well that's nice. IS it going well?
I am beyond mad.  My neighbor was mowing his lawn and my car got scratched from rocks kicked out by the mower! \ That really stinks! Did you complain to him? 
Yes!  He said it was my problem and not his! \ Wow...What a bad neighbor! Maybe insurance will cover it?
I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous! \ Congratulations!  Don't be too nervous!  You must have done something right to get the job in the first place!
That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous. \ That is natural.  I'm sure you will do great!
I fail at every diet I try. \ That sucks.  Do you always try specific diets or do you sometimes just try to eat less?

I did. I fell back asleep, i don't even remember how, all i remember is waking up in the morning. Apparently it's called sleep paralysis  \ I've heard of it, but I can't even imagine going through it.  I'm sorry it happened to you.
My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home. \ Wow, i bet you miss her so much. My wife is going overseas with our son and they will be gone for 1 month! I know i will be miserable without them

Yes, it is nice when communities watch out for each other. \ My community is great about that kind of thing. I'm glad you got your money back!
Yes I am glad too. I rewarded the person by giving them what I had dropped since they appeared to need it more than me. \ Oh that's great! That's really nice of you. 
My boyfriend and I celebrated our sixth anniversary the other week. I was pretty sure he was planning to propose because of the nice plans he had made- and he was. For a couple of days leading up to it I was so excited and just could hardly wait.  \ Wow that is exciting for sure. You must have been filled with anticipation.
I was, even though I was a bit just antsy to find out if I was even right. I was really happy! \ I certainly hope he did propose and that you are still happily living.
Yep he did, he is my fiance now! Thank you. (: \ Congratulations! Good luck with your future marriage.
I had to work late yesterday. \ That stinks :( Why did you have to work late?
Employee incompetence. \ You should quit. There's nothing worse than a workplace with employees who can't carry their own weight.
I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet. \ What has you so nervous?
I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there? \ Have you considered taking a weekend trip there to see how you like it?
One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me. \ Did it leave you to do it alone, or were there others ?
There were others, but we needed all the help we could get. \ I see how that would be frustrating.
I'm trying to overcome some depressive episodes that I've been having. \ I'm sorry you're having trouble :(  Is there anyone you can talk to about it?

I'm so glad it finally cooled down outside! I hate heat and humidity, makes me feel so miserable \ I hear you. It's been super hot and humid here for weeks. The only time i get out of the house is to go to the pool or get groceries lol
ha! I don't even want to go to the pool \ why not? the pool is nice and cool :) i just hate staying home for a long time
Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time \ I've heard about this movie but i've never had a chance to watch it
omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens \ Aliens? I didn't think it was about aliens, i thought it's about ghosts and stuff
There si always a fight when my family gets together \ Is it more of verbal arguing or flat out physical fights?
Both. We aren't going to have thanksgiving together this year. They cancelled it last thanksgiving. ITs terrible \ Wow. What do they usually argue about? 
The stupidest thing \ my family gets into politics a lot, but fortunately it rarely turns hostile.
it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it. \ Well I wouldn't know lol
Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice. \ I don't have any sharing friends either lol. You're lucky

I'm pleased with how I've been handling a large amount of stress lately. \ That's good, stress is so common in life so it's easy to become overwhelmed.
Yes, it is. I'm learning to just put my head down and get to work digging out. \ That's an impressive philosophy, you seem to have grit so I think you will go far.
I recently had a close family member who fell ill after being laid off from her job. I didn't like seeing her struggle to pay medical bills so I had to help. \ That's very nice of you. We need more compassion in the world for sure.
I agree, but in my case it was easy to feel that way because she is family and I am familiar with her. I even feel like I owe her. \ I understand. But my family turns a deaf ear. I'm pleased that you did not.

It went so well, people were impressed \ That's wonderful, it must feel good to see your preparation pay off.
A friend told me about a local barbecue restaurant so I decided to stop by a few days ago. \ What sort of meat did they have?

The guy standing in line next to me at starbucks this morning smelled really bad. \ Oh man. Was it body odor like he hasn't showered or something on him like smoke or animal stink?
Stink.  I don't mind the smell of smoke. \ yeah I typically can't stand the smell of BO either. There really is no excuse. Just take a shower man!
I have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well. I'm glad I got him as a puppy. \ Did you start training him when he was young?
oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped. \ That's awesome. I love a well trained dog.
Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff. \ I know lots of bad dog parents. I've got a well trained dog too so, I understand.
I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat. \ Oh no!  What happened to it?
It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :( \ So sad!  I am sorry.  Don't feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside.
I am really nervous.  I have to go tomorrow to get my tooth pulled and I am scared to death.  I hate the dentist! \ Oh no! I hate the dentist too! I haven't been in forever. I'm sorry. You will be okay though! Hoping it all goes well. Is it hurting you?
Not really, but I want to have it done before something bad like that happens. \ That makes total sense! Good job for thinking ahead like that!
There were 3 HUGE spiders in my house yesterday! I had to kill the first one, and then my husband killed the second and then when he was spraying (because I made him) he found a third! \ Holy moly! I hate spiders...You should spray your house more, just in case!
Yes he is going to when he gets home today, but meanwhile ive armed myself with one of his shoes wherever I go in the house! \ Hahaha! I would too, but keep some bug spray close too!

I have always been appreciative of my parents paying for college \ consider yourself lucky
I do everyday, I know it was truly a blessing \ better that than to be drowned in studen tloan
I've been quite upset with my daughter's school as they've really let her down. To make a long story short. Since she's now the only surviving 8th grade strings student (violin), they've lumped her in with the regular band this year rather than let her play with the 7th grade strings class. \ I would be upset too! Why would they do that? did you try talking to teachers or principal?
They'd have to hire someone to teach just her this year. Next year, there will be more, but she'll be gone. Yes, I've talked to everyone and they're not going to do anything until next year, after it's too late to do my daughter any good as she'll be moving on to high school. \ gosh that's frustrating! I'm sorry to hear that
I broke my coffee maker today and i'm so mad because i can't make coffee. I can't survive the morning without coffee \ Anyplace near you where you can get a cup?

When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication. \ Oh no, did you find a backup caterer
Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need. \ Of course, the wedding can be the most stressful event of your life
I walked into a job interview unprepared, I was actually given the job days later which was a blessing \ Nice.  I've never had luck with being unprepared for things, I always choke.
The key might be to fake it until you make it \ Probably.  I'm just bad at faking it :P
I feel very ready for my college exam. \ That's great. I hope you do well!
Thank you. I think it will be easy! \ Good luck!
I caught my boyfriend messaging another girl. \ That is awful! Did you break up with him?

so i'm trying to participate in a bodybuilding contest. I was working really hard to get fit and i really think i can win \ How many hours a day are you training
It depends on what i'm doing cardio or weight lifting. Usually 2-3 hours and i rest on saturday \ Good For you, I am really envious of people that take the time to work on their body
I went to make a sandwich one day and the entire laof of bread was covered in mold! \ ewww! that's gross. I actually made a toast for my son yesterday and when i was about to give it to him i noticed a little bit of mold on the side. i almost threw up
I was gagging and had to get some fresh air \ i bet your appetite was ruined!
I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night. \ What happened?
I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door. \ Oh wow, I would of been terrified!
I am patiently waiting to hear back from a recent job interview \ How do you think the interview went?
It went well, but you know that feeling you get in your stomach where it could go either way? \ Yes, that uncertainty is always tough to deal with.  But I hope you get the job!
harvey weinstein made such great movies until he ruined it \ What were some of your favorites?
too much to name \ I see, hopefully someone can fulfill his role
